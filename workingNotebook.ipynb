       " 'Washington Post Highlights PredPol in Predictive Analytics Story The Washington Post highlighted PredPol\\'s partnership with the Santa Cruz Police Department in a feature story today on predictive analytics.The story talks about the usage of predictive analytics in law enforcement and the successes throughout the greater Washington, DC region. Here is an excerpt from the story: \"... PredPol was started by California researchers who helped a police department in Santa Cruz predict crime to guide the department\\'s dwindling resources. \"In the last decade, we had a 30 percent increase in calls for service and a 20 percent decline in staff,\" said Zach Friend, the department\\'s crime analyst at the time, who is now a member of the county\\'s board of supervisors. \"We knew we weren\\'t going to get more cops on the street.\" At the beginning of beat officers\\' shifts, they now are given a map detailing which crimes might occur -- burglaries, car break-ins, thefts -- within an identified zone. In the first six months of the program, burglaries declined 19 percent.\" Click here for the complete story.',\n",
       " 'Alhambra Police Laud PredPol Successes From the Pasadena Star News - February 11, 2014 By Zen Vuong ALHAMBRA >> A year after the Police Department implemented predictive policing software, car burglaries and vehicle thefts have decreased, Chief Mark Yokoyama said. In January 2013, Alhambra was the first law-enforcement agency in Southern California to have citywide implementation of PredPol, a cloud-based software that forecasts areas where crimes are likely to be committed. Nine months ago, some residents expressed reservations about technology that could target the homeless or minorities, but co-founder Jeffrey Brantingham, a UCLA anthropology professor, said PredPol doesn\\'t use personal information to predict crime. \"It doesn\\'t include who the offenders are or what type of music they like or anything like that,\" he said. \"It\\'s focusing on where the crimes are happening. The public calls the police and report crime. Police are using data they are given. They\\'re actually doing what the public wants. It\\'s nothing like \\'Minority Report\\' or criminal profiling.\" PredPol uses five years\\' worth of law-breaking data to map a 500-by-500-square-foot area where crime will likely happen. The technology essentially places officers at the right place and time to prevent lawbreaking. The Alhambra Police Department focused on the two most common crimes in Alhambra, Yokoyama said. By year\\'s end, when compared to 2012 numbers, car burglaries decreased by 21 percent, and auto theft declined by 8 percent, a statistics report showed. Yokoyama said the system works. He recalled a time when police officers were patrolling Valley Boulevard at PredPol\\'s direction and noticed a suspicious vehicle. They found ski masks inside the vehicles and arrested the individuals on suspicion of robbery, he said. \"The act of robbery, burglary, et cetera does not have to be committed for a crime to occur,\" Yokoyama said. \"The planning and actions toward committing the crime is a crime in and of itself. In fact, it would always be our preference to stop a crime at this stage than for an act to occur.\" Yokoyama added that giving officers direct, clear missions to patrol particular areas has had a positive effect that residents and business owners have noticed. \"It\\'s actually increased our communication and visibility to the community because (police officers are) spending more time in the residential area, as an example,\" Yokoyama said. \"I get (positive) calls all the time about why the police are in their neighborhood more.\" Residents such as William Rising, however, said he hasn\\'t noticed more officers on the streets. But he said response time to emergency calls has improved. \"Just a more visible police presence can avert many potential criminal activities, such as car theft, break-ins and drug dealing,\" he said in a Facebook post. In addition to printouts of potential crime areas, Yokoyama said every police car is now equipped with in-car computers that receive refreshed information every five minutes. In general, he said, officers spend about 35 percent of their time doing random patrols based on their knowledge of the city, and they spend 5 percent of their time focused in the 500-by-500-square-foot areas to which PredPol directs them. Yet the crime rate for certain activities has increased. Residential burglaries went up by 17 percent and robberies increased by 22 percent, a report found. \"Although the numbers are up, based on PredPol predictions, we feel a number of crimes were prevented and would have been higher if not for PredPol missions,\" Yokoyama said.',\n",
       " 'PredPol Featured on CNN Faced with declining budgets and greater demands on service police departments are looking for tools that help deploy resources more effectively. As a recent feature story on CNN noted, one major resource emerging for law enforcement is predictive policing - spearheaded by a new California-based company called PredPol. Zach Friend, a Crime Analyst with the Santa Cruz Police Department, one of the first agencies in the nation to deploy this program noted, \"we\\'re facing a situation where we have 30 percent more calls for service but 20 percent less staff than in the year 2000, and that is going to continue to be our reality. So we have to deploy our resources in a more effective way. This model does that.\" So what exactly is predictive policing? Predictive policing shifts how police resources are allocated; from the reactive to the proactive. As CNN reported, the program is called PredPol (short for predictive policing), and it calculates its forecasts based on times and locations of previous crimes, combined with sociological information about criminal behavior and patterns. The technology has been beta tested in the Santa Cruz, California police department for the past year, and in an L.A. police precinct for the past six months, with promising results. In fact, Santa Cruz Police have seen a 19 percent reduction in burglaries since implementing the program while Los Angeles Police have seen 25 percent reduction.  LAPD estimates the implementation of the program has saved over $4 million in costs to the community. More information about the company can be found at www.predpol.com',\n",

       " 'Santa Clara Newspaper Features PredPol From The Santa Clara newspaper... Putting a cop at the crime scene before it happens with a mathematical formula sounds like it came straight out of a Hollywood movie, but with new technology, it\\'s now possible. George Mohler, an assistant professor in the mathematics and computer science department at Santa Clara University, is one of the masterminds behind Predictive Policing, a new computer software. His company, PredPol, may be the next era of crime prevention. Since police departments nationwide are facing budget cuts, this new resource allows them to be more effective and responds to public demand for crime prevention without spending more money. Mohler started working with a team of researchers from the University of California Mathematical and Simulation Modeling of Crime project, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation. The UC MaSC project has one goal: to develop a statistical model for crime. With the help of research from this group, Mohler was able to come up with a mathematical equation to predict crime based on the same formula currently used to predict aftershocks for earthquakes. After publishing papers about his theory, Zach Friend, Santa Cruz Police crime analyst, reached out to Mohler about implementing the algorithm. The predictive policing program was put to the test. \"We decided to try the predictive policing program because our department had experienced about a 20 percent decline in staffing coupled with a 30 percent increase in call-for-services,\" said Friend. Since implementing the program, there has been a decrease in Santa Cruz crime, including residential, commercial and vehicular burglaries, dropping all burglaries by 27 percent. Another experiment with Los Angles Police Department saw similar drops in crime. Mohler presented the statistical model to one of his classes at Santa Clara. One of his calculus students, Omar Qazi, approached Mohler after the discussion. \"I knew I could make his software better,\" said Qazi. Qazi and Mohler started working together to further develop the software. \"(Qazi) has ultimately made this software better, and I would work with him regardless of his age because he is a unique, talented individual,\" said Mohler. PredPol analyzes the times, dates and places of recent crimes. It updates constantly when new crimes occur and then finds patterns that forecast high-risk times and locations for future crime. The cost to implement PredPol depends on the population of the city, but it is always less than the cost of hiring an officer for a year. PredPol may violate the Fourth Amendment, however, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Professor Andrew Ferguson from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law wrote an article called \"Predictive Policing and Reasonable Suspicion,\" examining predictive policing and the possibilities of how it will impact reasonable suspicion. \"In the future, predictive policing will affect the Fourth Amendment reasonable suspicion analysis,\" said Ferguson. \"How it affects it and whether these changes weaken or strengthen Fourth Amendment protections remains unclear.\" Friend said, \"The program is not a replacement for an officer\\'s talents, intuition or experience. It is simply a tool that helps them do their job.\" The Sponsored Projects Office at the university assists in proposal, funding, developing project ideas and submitting completed project plans. Mary-Ellen Fortini, director of Sponsored Projects, reviewed the grant Mohler submitted for PredPol. \"We have to balance between the gain and the risk -- do the risks outweigh the benefits?\" said Fortini. \"In this case, predictive policing benefits outweigh the risk.\" Major cities around the United States including San Francisco, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, Los Gatos, and as far away as Kent, England are using PredPol today. The future of the war against crime now blinks on a computer screen. Contact Christie Vaughn at cvaughn@scu.edu.',\n",

       " '\\n\\tAustralian Newspaper Features PredPol Australia\\'s Brisbane Times featured Dr. Jeff Brantingham and PredPol looking at the mathematical and anthropological reasons the PredPol model works. The paper noted the remarkable predictive accuracy of PredPol and the significant crime drops experienced in Los Angeles divisions that have implemented the program. Here is an excerpt from the article: \"Marked on the maps are a series of red boxes outlining 150-metre-long squares superimposed over the streets they will patrol. The boxes indicate, with spooky accuracy, where the division\\'s most common crimes are most likely to be committed during the 12-hour shift. The Predictive Policing project, or Pred Pol as it has become known, has been so successful in cutting crime rates since it was tested in Foothill in 2011 that it has spread to seven other LA police divisions, with more to come. Twenty or so police departments across the US have signed on, as have departments in Britain. It is understood at least one Australian force is in talks to sign up.\"',\n",
       " 'Predictive Policing Showing Early Success in Kent England An article in Euro News today spoke of the success of PredPol in Kent, England. The story is below and can be found at: http://www.euronews.com/2013/02/25/forecasting-crime/ Weather forecasting is a standard fixture but how about forecasting crime? Well, a new software programme called \"PredPol\" claims to do just that and is being trialled in the UK, by police in Kent. Detective Sergeant Martin Smith explained: \"Each box represents a 500 foot square area. The algorithm is telling us it\\'s an important part of the area to police. In the last 180 days, you\\'ve had a burglary, three vehicle crimes, four violent crimes and four criminal damages. The boxes are all lettered, so from A to Z. A, B, C, D are the most high priority.\" The crime prediction boxes are the result of the same calculations used to predict earthquakes. Using records crime data and human behaviour, the system predicts areas where offences are likely to take place. Officers receive updates from the system twice a day and then decide where to patrol. Inspector Garry Woodward said: \"It\\'s the real demographics of the area, the people, the places, what kind of buildings they are, taller buildings might mean there\\'s more crime or less, it takes into account everything.\" So far it seems that \"PredPol\" is driving down crime and helping to increase police visibility by advising officers where to deploy. Detective Inspector Jonathan Sutton said: \"It will identify a location where we are able to prevent crime from happening. By preventing crime, that naturally reduces our demand and therefore allows us to be more visible, more pro-active in our policing.\" The trials in Kent are still in the early stages but when the system was tested in California, reported crime fell by 12%, and burglaries by 27% - which is good news for all concerned.',\n",

       " '\\n\\tAlhambra Police\\'s Success with PredPol Featured in International Newspaper Alhambra, California Police Department\\'s usage of PredPol (and the success with the program) was highlighted in the international publication Global Times.  Here is the story: -- A medium-sized city in southern California has successfully reduced the crime rates during the first six months of this year thanks to the adoption of a sophisticated technology, local officials said Monday. Alhambra, an independent city with a population of more than 80, 000, was the first in southern California to utilize Predictive Policing (PredPol), a cutting-edge technology across its police department, a move which has bore positive results, according to city police chief Mark Yokoyama. \"PredPol does not replace the experience and intuition of our great officers, but is rather an invaluable added tool that allows our police force to use their patrol time more efficiently and helps stop crime before it happens,\" he said at a briefing with local Chinese-language media. \"This technology offers an excellent crime-fighting solution that will ultimately make Alhambra safer.\" The city, situated in the western San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County which has faced with a trend in rising crime, has seen the rate of residential burglary and other major crimes significantly dropped six months after it launched the project in January, 2013, aiming at adding the technology to the police arsenal of crime fighting strategies in an effort to be proactive in addressing crime issues. Armed with the advanced technology which predicts or forecasts future crimes, an Alhambra officer can patrol an identified area for car burglaries and find a car burglary in progress, which led to an immediate arrest, authorities said. The police department can also find crimes occurring in the identified areas as had been forecasted, thereby validating the predictions and have also made associated arrests for other crimes while in the forecasted areas, Yokoyama said. Three most common crimes including car theft, theft from vehicles and auto burglary have gone down by 7 percent, 20 percent and 32 percent, respectively, according to Yokoyama. Residential burglary also dropped by 2 percent from late last year, he said. \"PredPol technology gives officers the best chance to be in the right place, at the right time, to stop crime before it occurs while at the same time helping to reduce crime, cut costs, and increase accuracy when officers patrol their beats,\" the veteran police officer said. PredPol, a software program which was developed over a period of six years by police officers, mathematicians, criminologists and anthropologists, based itself on previous crime reports including the time and location of a crime, and drew upon from sociological studies of criminal behavior including the insight that burglars often ply the same area. The software program looks at burglaries and car thefts and other crimes in a similar manner as predicting aftershocks from an earthquake, Yokoyama said. Alhambra has registered some 430 cases during the latter half of 2012, according to statistics provided by the police.',\n",
       " 'Atlanta Police Chief George Turner Highlights PredPol Usage In the latest issue of Police Chief Magazine, Atlanta Police Chief George Turner co-authored an article about his department\\'s innovative use of PredPol - and how predictive policing has reduced crime in Atlanta. The story is below - for the complete link click here. We pride ourselves on being a department that is not satisfied with the status quo. We are forward-looking, with a strategic view grounded in innovation. We know the PredPol technology has helped us get smarter on our fight against crime. olicing crime patterns is hard business. Atlanta, Georgia, is no different than any other jurisdiction in this regard. Every day sees new crimes added to the database; and every day, the Atlanta police seek to use these data to not only respond to victims, but also to try to get out ahead of emerging hotspots and prevent crime in the first place. Until recently, the Atlanta Police Department (APD) followed a system for daily mission planning that combined hotspot mapping with the selective use of street-level intelligence. Beginning in July of 2013 for 90 days, the APD added predictive policing to the mix in two policing zones, targeting burglary, car theft, and robbery. Aggregate crime declined by 8 percent and 9 percent in the two zones compared to the prior 90-day period, with burglary and car thefts falling 10 to 28 percent. Aggregate crimes in the zones that did not deploy predictive policing increased from 1 to 8 percent. On the basis of these results, the APD decided to deploy predictive policing, as developed by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and provided by PredPol, across the city.1 The decision, though, was based on more than observed declines in crime; it was based also on a review of the science behind predictive policing and, equally important, the seamless way in which predictive policing fits within the department\\'s day-to-day operations. The Science behind Predictive Policing If one can accurately predict where and when crime will occur today, then law enforcement personnel can disrupt those crimes before they happen. But predicting where and when crime will occur is no simple task. While crime may concentrate in some of the same neighborhoods year after year, the daily variation in where and when crimes occur is often large. A neighborhood may experience multiple burglaries over the course of a year, but only one or two houses in that neighborhood may be at risk today, while tomorrow it might be two different houses on the other side of the same neighborhood. It is very difficult to predict where crime will occur in the next 10-12 hours simply based on where it occurred recently. Extensive research has shown that short-term crime patterns are driven by interactions among (1) crime generators that are built-in features of the environment; (2) repeat and near-repeat victimization that leads previous victims and their neighbors to be at greater risk of follow-on crimes; (3) the routine activity patterns of offenders and victims that keeps risk local; and (4) substantial random noise. Each of these processes is well-known empirically, but when put together, their relationship to the emergence, spread, and disappearance of crime hotspots over time is incredibly complex. Using real-time data piped in from Atlanta\\'s records management system, PredPol\\'s methodology uses high-powered mathematics to calculate probabilities of where and when crime will occur today. The mathematics are closely related to those used to study earthquakes. Any one crime can be linked to crime generators in the environment or recent nearby crime events in the same way that an earthquake can be classified as a main shock tied to a fault in the earth or an aftershock occurring closely on the heels of a previous quake. What matters most is that the mathematics allow police to not only characterize past crime, but also use past crime to forecast with great accuracy the locations where crime will occur in the immediate future. The mathematics also allows Atlanta police to forecast crime at a very fine scale while constantly adapting to crime patterns as they change from day to day. PredPol predictions identify 500 x 500 foot boxes that are at the greatest risk of crime in the coming shift. This is about the same area as four American football fields arranged side by side. The value of identifying such a small area is that police can zero in on a location with the greatest risk of crime today and distinguish it from nearby areas that are at significantly lower risk. Further, a location that is at low risk of crime today may be at high risk tomorrow, so patrol units see different boxes on different days depending on each area\\'s risk level for that specific day. Predictive Accuracy in Atlanta How accurate is predictive policing? To answer this question, one first needs to count how many crimes actually occurred in active prediction boxes. The second step is to take into account the percentage of the total policing area represented by active predictions. The value of predictive policing is maximized by predicting as much crime as possible in as small of an area as possible. Atlanta deployed predictive policing in July 2013 in two urban policing zones. Zone 4 is located to the southwest of downtown Atlanta and is characterized by mostly residential and some business areas. Zone 6 is located to the east of downtown and has retail, residential, and many restaurant areas. Both zones record some of the highest volume of Part 1 crimes in the city. The focus in Zone 4 was on burglary and robbery during the day shift, vehicle crime and robbery during the evening shift, and vehicle crime during the morning shift. The focus in Zone 6 was on burglary and vehicle crime during the day and evening shift, and all Part 1 crimes in the morning (reduced to only robbery after 45 days). The total land area of Zone 4 is 31 square miles and Zone 6 is 15 square miles. In total, 21 and 18 hotspots were predicted for each shift in Zone 4 and 6 respectively. In Atlanta, crime over the initial 90-day deployment was 24 times more likely to occur inside an active PredPol prediction box than elsewhere in the environment. This was measured by tabulating the number of crimes that occurred within each box and creating a Predictive Accuracy Index (PAI) score. The PAI is the percentage of crimes accurately predicted, normalized by the percent of the geographic area covered by the predictions. A PAI value of 1 corresponds to random chance, so a useful prediction must at least have a higher value than 1. Over the deployment period, the PAI value for Zone 4 was 23.7, and the Zone 6 PAI was 24.0. Before and After Predictive Policing in Atlanta Crime rates across all six Atlanta policing zones for the 90-day period prior to deployment in the summer of 2013 were compared with the 90-day period following deployment. As already noted, for Part 1 crimes in total, Zones 4 and 6 (the zones with predictive policing) experienced crime rate reductions of 9 percent and 8 percent, respectively. In all four of the zones where PredPol was not deployed, crime rates increased from 1 percent to 8 percent. In Zones 4 and 6, burglary rates dropped by 21 percent and 10 percent and auto theft rates dropped by 15 percent and 28 percent. Higher variance was observed in robbery rate changes due to the lower volume of robbery compared to property crime and the corresponding lower weight assigned to robbery in PredPol predictions. Robbery dropped by 34 percent in Zone 6, but increased by 31 percent in Zone 4. Using Predictive Policing in the Field There are no constraints on how a police department can use predictions to deter and prevent crime. They can be distributed to specialized units such as auto theft or robbery details, or they can be used by patrol officers as part of their daily routines. In Atlanta, missions were distributed at the start of each watch to patrol officers who were given the directive to police prediction boxes during their available time. Importantly, predictive policing does not replace the knowledge, skills, or experience of an analyst or patrol officer. Predictive policing provides information on where and when crime is most likely to occur, but it does not say how or why crimes are committed or who is potentially responsible. Patrol officers operate in ways they already know, while analysts spend less valuable time on mapmaking and more time working on the challenging problems that require their expert skills. Predictions also provide timely information about the distribution of risk that works seamlessly with analyst-developed criminal intelligence and department-driven community policing. The compelling results from the initial deployment in Zones 4 and 6 in Atlanta led to a city-wide rollout of predictive policing in November 2013. By and large, this move to make predictive policing a part of every officer\\'s daily routine has been favorably received by the front line. Leadership Matters Not surprisingly, any change in policing comes with challenges. Predictive policing is easy to use, is accurate, and impacts crime, but it requires a commitment on the part of command staff, supervisors, and patrol officers to put it to good use. Atlanta prides itself on being a department that is not satisfied with the status quo. It is forward-looking, with a strategic view grounded in innovation. Atlanta police officers know the PredPol technology has helped them get smarter in their fight against crime. The launch of predictive policing in Atlanta resulted from the partnership between the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) and the APD. The Atlanta Police Foundation is a non profit, public/private partnership focused on advancing public safety in Atlanta. In partnership with the City of Atlanta, the APD, and the business community, the APF provides research on policing best practices, strategic direction, and resources to help the APD incubate innovation, keep pace with technology, and meet strategic time-sensitive needs that help drive down crime and make Atlanta a safer city. The APF funded the initial three years of the project and are currently evaluating the results in the Technology Innovation Center where interns and professors from local universities are using quantitative methods to ensure the success and best deployment of the system. \"Predictive policing and the Technology Innovation Center have become banner programs for the Atlanta Police Foundation and have aided in significant crime reduction and prevention in Atlanta over the past year,\" said Dave Wilkinson, president and CEO of the APF. \"We are helping to position the Atlanta Police Department as a national leader in cutting edge, technology-based policing solutions. We recently published our annual crime report, which showed that crime in Atlanta between 2002 and 2012 decreased at nearly double the national rate--a true testament to the success of the partnership between the APF, the APD, and Atlanta\\'s business community.\"2?',\n",
       " '\\n\\tKMWorld Magazines Features PredPol KM on the crime beat In Santa Cruz, Calif., the police force has successfully reduced crime by nearly 20 percent in the past year, aided in part by a software product called PredPol, which predicts areas where crime is most likely to occur. \"We knew that getting more officers on staff was not a realistic option,\" says Zach Friend, crime analyst for the Santa Cruz Police Department (SCPD). \"We were looking for a way to allocate our resources more efficiently.\" In exploring software solutions that might help support resource allocation decisions, Friend came across a research report on a project that had brought together an interdisciplinary team, including an anthropologist and mathematicians, to develop models that reflected patterns of crime. \"The software had been tested on a sample of data but not in an operational setting,\" Friend says. \"We partnered with the research group to find out whether the software could be effective in a real-world setting, using the police reports in our records management system.\" Before moving forward with the effort, the SCPD tested the system by providing five years of information to PredPol and challenging it to predict a sixth year, for which the department already had information. \"The software predicted a significant percentage of crime for that year, so we decided to incorporate it into our operations,\" Friend adds. The SCPD spent about six months working with researchers to determine what the output of the analyses should look like, and launched the PredPol system in fall 2011. The software tracks residential and commercial burglaries, auto break-ins and auto theft. Likely \"hot spots\" Before each shift starts, a patrol sergeant or supervisor logs onto the system and the screen shows 15 \"hot spot\" locations outlined in a red box. A map is printed out that officers take with them on their patrol. \"We have 13 square miles to cover,\" Friend says. \"The software identifies the zones where we are most likely to have problems and therefore lets us use our resources better.\" Police reports are automatically run though the PredPol algorithm every hour to keep the system updated. In any given hour, an officer has approximately 15 minutes that is not dedicated to an activity such as responding to a 911 call or conducting pre-scheduled patrols. During that time, the officers move into the red box areas. In several dozen cases, that process has produced arrests by officers who were in the right place at the right time. However, the ultimate goal is to prevent crimes from occurring in the first place. \"The arrests provided good feedback that the system was working,\" Friend explains, \"but PredPol also reduced crime through prevention.\" PredPol, a SaaS product, eliminates the need for capital investment in software and is less expensive than a full-fledged business intelligence platform. It can be extended, however, and has the capability to perform additional analytics. Officers are now requesting that additional types of crime be built into the system, so the SCPD plans to expand its analyses into street crimes such as robberies and assaults. PredPol achieves a delicate balance between sophistication and usability. \"It was important not to increase the complexity of what officers already had to do on the street,\" says Jeff Brantingham, cofounder of PredPol and chief of R&D. \"Although the mathematics are complex, the \\'hot spot\\' boxes tell the officers in a straightforward way where they can have the greatest impact.\" The several hundred inquiries that the company has received from law enforcement agencies reflect the need for an affordable and effective solution to the challenge of reducing crime at a time when resources are tight.',\n",

Bill Grogan. \"I don\\'t care how science fiction or how far out there it is, the proof is in the pudding.\" The program was developed by researchers at UCLA. Grogan said his department is the first in the Southeast to use it, and his officers have reported several instances where they made arrests thanks to cues from the software. It predicts crime in specific areas, every 12 hours. The predictions are based on crime history over the last three years, and take into account time of day and time of year.

       " 'National Public Radio Features Seattle Police\\'s PredPol Deployment NPR\\'s All Things Considered did a national feature story on Seattle Police\\'s usage of PredPol - in addition, NPR noted that Seattle Police have just begun using the predictive policing program for gun violence predictions.  The following provides an overview of the story by Martin Kaste. \"Typically, police arrive at the scene of a crime after it occurs. But rather than send cops to yesterday\\'s crime, a new trend in law enforcement is using computers to predict where tomorrow\\'s crimes will be -- and then try to head them off. The software uses past statistics to project where crime is moving. Police in Los Angeles say it\\'s worked well in predicting property crimes there. Now Seattle is about to expand it for use in predicting gun violence. It all started as a research project. Jeff Brantingham, an anthropologist at UCLA, wanted to see if computers could model future crime the same way they model earthquake aftershocks. Turns out they can. \"It predicts sort of twice as much crime as any other existing system, even going head-to-head with a crime analyst,\" Brantingham says. Older systems, like the famous CompStat in New York, show where crime has been. This system looks forward. \"The model will actually predict other locations, that effectively say, even though there was a crime somewhere else in your environment, the risk is still greatest in this location today for the next 10 hours or the next 12 hours,\" Brantingham explains. Brantingham and his colleagues are now selling the predictive system to police departments with the name PredPol. At this point, you may be thinking about the sci-fi movie Minority Report. But this is different. No psychics sleeping in bathtubs, for one. More to the point, this doesn\\'t predict who will commit a future crime, just where it is likely to happen. In Seattle, police Sgt. Christi Robbin zooms in on a map of the city. Earlier this year, Seattle started using PredPol to predict property crimes. It\\'s now the first place to try predicting gun violence with the software. \"These red boxes [on the map] are predictions of where the next crimes are likely to occur,\" Robbin explains. At the start of every shift, patrol cops are assigned to those red boxes. \"So we\\'re asking that they spent the time in that 500-by-500-square-foot box, doing whatever proactive work they can to prevent that crime,\" Robbin says. On a recent shift, officer Philip Monzon pulls up inside his box; today, it\\'s a city block near the Seattle waterfront. \"[The police] want visibility, they want contacts with businesses as are appropriate, and anyone who\\'s wandering through the area,\" Monzon explains.

       " 'Richmond Police Use PredPol to Prevent Crime Below is an article from the Richmond Confidential - shared by SFGate Blog: Each morning, Richmond Police Lt. Andre Hill turns on his computer and looks at where crime is most likely to occur in the city.  \"If you look here, there\\'s five red boxes in the iron triangle for the day shift,\" Hill said, while pointing at his computer screen. Each box represents a two and a half square block area where burglaries, car thefts, and robberies are most likely to take place. RPD officers in patrol spend at least 40 minutes per shift in each of the boxes. \"They park their car, get out, walk around, and engage with the community,\" Hill said. Theoretically, their presence will suppress crime before it happens. The computer system is called predictive policing. It\\'s an algorithm--similar to one used to predict aftershocks from an earthquake--that analyzes data and forecasts the likelihood of crimes occurring in certain areas. \"With this system, we can say that between 6 o\\'clock and 10 o\\'clock at night, this is where crime is most likely to occur,\" RPD Captain Mark Gagan said. \"With that information we can be much more focused.\" RPD began using the system in June. While it\\'s too soon to definitively say whether or not it has been effective, the system has been widely praised both within the department, and by other California police agencies. The Santa Cruz police department implemented the system in 2011, and since then overall crime has declined significantly--the only way to measure the system\\'s efficacy since it\\'s meant to prevent crime from occurring. However, according to police records, calls for service and arrests have increased, the latter by 56 percent. \"From a statistician\\'s point of view you wouldn\\'t expect that,\" Santa Cruz Deputy Chief Steven Clark said. With more calls for service and more arrests, logically one would expect more crime. However, the data suggests that police are increasingly in the right place at the right time. \"It seems like the program\\'s working, especially when you look at the surrounding communities that are dealing with increases in crime,\" Clark said. The LAPD began using predictive policing in 2012, and results have been positive. In Richmond, vehicle theft is down 23 percent and burglaries are down 10 percent since this time last year, according to police records. The department hopes the system will help ease a recent spike in robberies, which have increased by 24 percent since last year. However, Captain Gagan said the system isn\\'t a panacea. \"Nothing is ever going to replace an officer\\'s ability to listen to people, talk to people, and connect to people,\" he said. The department is debating whether predictive policing maps would be more useful if they were publicly available, allowing residents to see where they\\'re most likely to become a victim of crime.  \"Having community looking out for each other and knowing what\\'s going on in the neighborhood is much more powerful than having police officers at the right place at the right time,\" Gagan said. However, because the technology is still new to the department, it has yet to decide what to do about making maps available to the public.  ',\n",
       " 'PredPol Receives Significant International Coverage Over the last few weeks PredPol, the predictive policing company, has received a significant amount of international coverage from their product deployment in Kent (the United Kingdom) and interest by agencies throughout Europe.  Here are excerpts from an article that ran in the Gravesend Reporter in England. \"Predicting the future is standard practice for weather forecasters, economists, think tanks and business. Now the police are finding their own way of mapping crime before it even happens...\\nThe software, PredPol - which stands for predictive policing - has been brought to north Kent straight from California for its first trials in the UK. In Santa Cruz and Los Angeles, where the software was first tested in 2011, crime dropped by 27 per cent and 12 per cent respectively in the first six months.It began as an academic project seven years ago involving mathematicians, social scientists and an anthropology professor whose goal was to understand how crime hot spots occur. They found that by using a mathematical algorithm similar to one for predicting earthquake aftershocks they could create predict where crimes would happen. Speaking to The Reporter Jeff Brantingham, anthropology professor at the University of California, explains: \"When there is an earthquake you see a lot about how it produces aftershocks. In general they occur near in time and place to a main shock. Crime is very much the same. It you look at crime hotspots they appear quickly and spread around. When a burglar breaks into a house it makes the chance of crime occurring close by much more likely.\" The PredPol software maps years of past crime data and is updated daily with the location, time and type of crime committed. From this it creates prediction boxes of precise 500 sq ft zones which are listed in priority order as to where crimes are most likely to occur, which is then delivered to the smart phones, tablets and PCs of police officers who use it to make decisions on where to deploy. Steve Clark, deputy chief of police at Santa Cruz Police Department told The Reporter: \"Every officer knows where they can go on their beat and likely make an arrest but a predictable habit can form. Sometimes that primal policing sense is right and sometimes it is not. PredPol doesn\\'t replace an officer\\'s intuition but rather adds science to those skills.\"',\n",

It was developed by a team that included mathematicians, criminologists and anthropologists.  In use at five Los Angeles Police Department divisions, the system seems to be helping.  Crime has dropped off between 12 and 27 percent in areas where Pred Pol has been implemented. The system developer Jeff Brantingham of UCLA explains that data from repeat crime victims is constantly re-calibrated which produces dynamic, graphic patterns that go beyond what humans can produce.

       " 'Government Technology Magazine Features PredPol Deployment in Tacoma The most recent issue of Government Technology Magazine highlighted the success of PredPol\\'s predictive policing software in deployments in Tacoma, Washington and Santa Cruz, CA. The article, Predicting the Epicenter of Crime: Analytics Tool Cuts Crime Rates, explained how PredPol works and how it is being deployed in the field. Here is the article written by John Twachtman: With the right kind of data analytics, geologists can predict earthquakes. Turns out those same principles can be applied to predicting crime. That concept has been turned into an analytics tool that is now being used by more than 20 police departments in the U.S. and one in the United Kingdom.  Chief of R&D and co-founder of predictive policing company PredPol Jeffrey Brantingham explained the comparison to Government Technology. \"Look at earthquakes. You have a complex terrain that has faults all over the place. ... Big ones, small ones, and they tend to generate earthquakes at a known rate. ... And when you have those earthquakes on those faults, they produce lots of aftershocks.\" Brantingham said that crime follows a similar pattern. \"The mathematical architecture being used to study crime is closely related to what you can use to study earthquakes.\" Brantingham said that there are features in the environment that, by their nature, are prone to crime, much like faults are to earthquakes. \"A shopping mall is a great example. It\\'s a standing crop of cars to be stolen or to be broken into. It\\'s not going anywhere. It\\'s like a big fault that produces earthquakes at a regular clip.\" Crimes also tend to produce \"aftershocks,\" as criminals tend to be creatures of habit and return to the same locations where they found previous success. \"So you get these after-crimes that occur near in space and near in time to previous crimes.\" PredPol takes that information - what crime is being committed, when and where it happens - and applies mathematical algorithms, and uses it as the basis to forecast where crime will happen in the future. The concept grew out of using hot spots to track where crime is occurring (where you map crime over long intervals to see where it is concentrated to aid in the allocation of resources). But PredPol cuts down the reaction time to changes in crime patterns that might not be readily apparent by simply looking at hot spots marked on a map, thus allowing for a more real-time reaction to changes in the crime landscape. But while the tool is about predicting crime, Brantingham also pointed out that this is not a profiling tool to identify who is committing crimes. \"We\\'re actually not saying anything about who, we are saying something about where and when crime is most likely to occur regardless of who may or may not be prone to commit those crimes,\" he said. For the Santa Cruz, Calif., Police Department, statistics show an overall decline in crime in targeted areas. From 2011, when PredPol was implemented to 2012, burglaries declined 22 percent, robberies declined 27 percent, assaults were down 9 percent and arrests were up 56 percent while auto theft recovery improved by 22 percent. Available year-to-date totals through August 2013 show robberies down 4 percent and assaults down 11 percent, and though burglaries are up 7 percent for the year so far, they have seen a decrease in recent months. Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark noted that crime patterns are dynamic, but having PredPol allows for more real-time reaction to those changing patterns. He also suggested that the big drop from 2011 to 2012 accounted for the \"low-hanging fruit\" and expects the reductions to be less dramatic in years to come. Clark noted that his department was an early partner of PredPol, helping validate the predictive modeling algorithms. He approached the company after reading an article about their research, hopeful it could help in Santa Cruz, particularly as the department was facing more calls for service and a decrease in \"unobligated minutes\" when officers can patrol while not on a call. Faced with static resources, Clark said the department recognized that it needed to be more effective with its unobligated minutes to help keep communities safe and maintain quality-of-life standards. The Tacoma, Wash., Police Department also is seeing a positive impact following the start of a year-long beta test that began March 1, 2013, though no statistics are yet available. Speaking on the decision to use the tool, Assistant Chief Pete Cribbin noted that in 2005, the Tacoma Police Department began strategic planning activities, one of which was to find ways to leverage data for more effective policing. \"The police department was collecting enormous amounts of data but not effectively using [it] in crime prevention efforts,\" Cribbin said. \"The goal was to become a data-driven organization with real-time data available to all officers, investigators and command staff.\" He noted that hot spot mapping and other tools were previously employed and PredPol has become an extension of those earlier efforts. Tacoma Police Department Crime Analyst Megan Yerxa added that officers \"have the ability to look at PredPol on their smartphones and laptops in real time and make adjustments as needed. It provides a much more focused way of policing that shifts the efforts beyond responding to crime to proactively preventing it by policing the probabilities for crime.\" The department is currently using PredPol to target property crime, including residential burglary, commercial burglary, motor vehicle theft, vehicle prowls and robbery. Cribbin anecdotally noted that because of adding the PredPol analytics tool, \"we have had several successes of catching the offender \\'red-handed\\' and making arrests.\" Santa Cruz\\'s Clark also pointed to some residual benefits in changing officer habits. \"Every officer out there knows a spot on their beat where they can go right now and arrest somebody,\" Clark said.

The story coincides with the International Association of Chief\\'s of Police Conference in Philadelphia, which PredPol is participating. Here is the story: Reading, Pa.,  is adopting a new, innovatie policing model. The Berks County city of 88,000 is partnering with PredPol, a Silicon Valley-based company on the Predictive Policing Technology. Reading Police Chief William Heim said after learning about the technology at a conference he decided to implement it because, \"it seemed to be the next step in crime mapping.\" Heim said the software does not replace talented, experienced officers, but it does help them do their jobs. \"We\\'re concentrating on property crimes particularly burglaries so that\\'s a crime that really impacts our citizens and we have unfortunately enough of them that we think that PredPol will be effective in letting us know where they may occur in the future and stopping the crime.\" Heim said the problem is, that mapping only tracks crimes that already happened. \"PredPol has created a software program that takes past data and criminal behavior and translates them into the areas where the next crimes are likely to occur.\" The program is paid for by a federal grant and costs $3,500 to implement and $17,500 a year. Reading\\'s been using the crime prediction technology for about a month and officers already have discovered a car theft and a burglary in progress by patrolling areas where crime was predicted to occur. Heim says he\\'s thankful for any additional tools. Zach Friend, a former crime analyst with the Santa Cruz Police Department, developed the model for PredPol. \"There\\'s something very futuristic about it but something very beautiful about being able to see through advanced mathematics and anthropological research that you can predict crime patterns and you can allocate resources more effectively.\" Reading is the first city in the Northeast to deploy the crime-predicting technology.',\n",
       " 'PredPol Slashes Crime in North Kent From Kent Online - by James Snaith A tough Los Angeles style of policing - which predicts crime before it happens - has seen street violence in north Kent slashed by 6%. Sounding more like a Hollywood blockbuster than crime-fighting in the county, the idea originated in the Californian city. It has now been adopted by police here as a way of cutting anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and street violence. PredPol uses software which reads the latest science, maths and human behaviour data to show the county\\'s top hotspot areas affected by crime. Officers are then sent to patrol targeted high-risk zones - sometimes as small as half the size of a football pitch - with the aim of tackling crime before it happens. Mark Johnson, Kent Police\\'s head of analysis said: \"Every day the system is fed new crime data, which is updated to produce new zones officers will target each day. \"It won\\'t change the way policing is done but it will predict crime in high-risk areas across the county in a targeted way so it helps us police more effectively. \"We\\'ve had an intelligence-led approach to crime in Kent for the last 25 years; this new system does not replace that, but will enhance it.\" A recent three-month pilot in North Kent saw levels of street violence fall by 6% when predictive policing was introduced. Kent Police\\'s Chief Constable Ian Learmonth said he was pleased with the results so far and is confident it will work across the county. He said: \"Instead of just doing a random patrol where we might come across or prevent a crime, the data tells us to go to a zone which is known to have recent levels of high risk crime and police there.\" It means more of a police presence in areas of Kent that have seen some of the highest levels of criminality. The Chief Constable added: \"The officers have enjoyed doing it because it takes them back to the policing style some joined to do. \"Officers are out, visible, doing foot patrols, engaging with the community, talking with the residents and they are dealing with the crimes they see as an added bonus. \"The public want to see visible policing on the streets; this allows us to do that.\"  ',\n",

In fact, burglaries in most parts of Santa Clara County have risen over the last year, some over 30 percent. In the city of Santa Cruz, reported residential and business burglaries dropped 14 percent from January to June 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. Meanwhile, Santa Clara County cities such as San Jose, Sunnvyale and Palo Alto have seen burglaries increase 30 percent or more in the same period. Law enforcement leaders over the hill said reduced police staffing has led to more of a focus on violent crime and less attention to property crimes. Yet Santa Cruz police spokesman Zach Friend said all agencies are facing more work with fewer resources. The question is how to deal with it. \"Even with staffing reductions, you have to look at new ways to cope,\" Friend said. If police don\\'t catch burglars, \"You can expect that person will go back to that hunting ground,\" he said. \"We think it\\'s important that we still apply resources to property crimes.\" Friend credited Santa Cruz police\\'s predictive policing system (PredPol), which places officers in city areas at specific times based on earlier property crimes.

Elsewhere in the 15,000-person northern Atlanta-area suburb that day, a deputy was patrolling around an extended-stay hotel in another area the software system had marked for extra scrutiny. She saw a man whom she thought looked suspicious. A background check revealed that her intuition was right.

       " 'Governing Magazine Features Santa Cruz Police and PredPol From Governing Magazine: Full article can be found here: By: John M. Kamensky The use of data to investigate and solve crime certainly isn\\'t new: Crime mapping has been used by detectives since it was developed by an Italian geographer and a French mathematician in 1829. Today, however, new data, statistical tools and other advanced technologies are helping police departments across the country turn traditional police officers into \"data detectives\" who not only solve crime but predict it. \"Predictive policing\" is an adaptation of business techniques initially developed by retailers such as Netflix and Walmart to predict the behavior of consumers. In a new research report for the IBM Center for the Business of Government, Dr. Jennifer Bachner of Johns Hopkins University tells compelling stories of the experiences that several cities are having in using these cutting-edge crime-busting methodologies. The Santa Cruz, Calif., police department was one of the first in the United States to embed predictive policing into its regular day-to-day operations. During the pilot phase, which began in mid-2011, burglaries dropped by 27 percent when compared to the previous year. Since then, the department has increased arrests by 56 percent and recovered 22 percent more stolen cars. What did the Santa Cruz police do? The core of the program, writes Bachner, is \"the continuous identification of areas that are expected to experience increased levels of crime in a specified time-frame.\" The system divides a map of the city into 150-by-150-meter cells. Drawing upon a database of past criminal incidents, a computer algorithm assigns probabilities of crime occurring to each cell, giving greater weight to more recent crimes. Prior to their shifts, officers are briefed on the locations of the 15 cells with the highest probabilities and encouraged to devote extra time to monitoring these areas. \"It\\'s almost like Neighborhood Watch in the next century,\" Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark wrote in a local newspaper. Bachner lists three categories of analytic techniques that Santa Cruz and other police departments are using to predict and prevent various kinds of crime: Analysis of space. There are about a half-dozen \"hot spot\" detection methods. \"Point location,\" for example, involves mapping specific addresses where crimes have been reported and looking for patterns, since crime is more likely to happen near locations that have experienced it in the past. In \"hierarchical cluster\" analysis, crime incidents are grouped to prioritize patterns. And in \"density mapping,\" the resulting map looks similar to a topographical map. Analysis of both space and time. A second, and related, set of techniques goes a step further. For example, a software program called CrimeStat III, developed by the National Institute of Justice, permits examination of the path a criminal has taken. With Series Finder, being developed at MIT, \"an analyst can perform a correlated walk analysis ... which examines the temporal and spatial relationships between incidents in a given sequence to predict the next incident,\" writes Bachner. But while this approach works in theory, she says, it \"requires refinement before it can be regularly used by police departments.\" Analysis of social networks. This approach, aimed at determining persons of interest rather than locations of interest, is new but growing in importance in the new age of social media. Like all human institutions, organized crime and gangs depend on interpersonal relationships. There are a number of different statistical and visualization tools that have been developed to analyze social networks, and Bachner reports that the Richmond, Va., police department, working with Virginia Commonwealth University, has developed a successful pilot program to integrate social network analysis into crime-fighting. Bachner doesn\\'t suggest that predictive analytics -- in policing or in other policy areas -- is some kind of silver bullet. It is an additional tool that supplements existing methods. Community policing, for example, remains an important strategy for deterring crime. \"Nevertheless,\" she notes, \"policing, like many other fields, is undoubtedly moving in a data-driven direction.\" Of course, having the technology doesn\\'t mean it will get used. Analytic techniques such as hierarchical and partitioned clusters can be intimidating to non-analysts. Bachner found that getting buy-in from the on-the-street police officer was crucial and that \"it cannot be imposed on unwilling officers as a replacement for experience and intuition.\" But once officers begin using the tools of predictive policing to supplement their traditional approaches, she writes, they like the results.',\n",

Early PredPol adopters Los Angeles Police (Foothill Division) recorded a day without reported crime - the first known instance of such an event. The following comes from the LAPD Media Advisory: On Thursday, February 13, 2014, LAPD\\'s Foothill Area recorded ZERO Part I crimes for the 24 hour period. This is the first time we have had a \"day without (recorded) crime\" in Foothill in recent memory and it may actually be the first time in our fifty year history where we had no crimes reported to the police. This is a tremendous achievement and a milestone for Foothill Area. To record zero crimes in a 24 hour period in a 50 square mile area of the San Fernando Valley, home to more than 250,000 people, is a tribute to the partnership and teamwork between the police and the public that we have formed over the last few years and an endorsement of the dogged determination of the police officers, detectives and civilian personnel that strive every day to make Foothill Area a safer place to live, work and play. By working closely with community groups, elected officials, other police agencies and social service providers the LAPD\\'s Foothill Area has been able to decrease crime significantly over the last five years. Crime has decreased steadily each year since 2009.  Part I or serious crime has been reduced from nearly 5,000 crime victims in 2009 to 3,800 for 2013, a 23% reduction. Violence is down even more dramatically from 888 victims of violence in 2009 to 510 last year.  That means that 378 fewer people in the communities of Pacoima, Sun Valley and Sunland-Tujunga have been touched by violence in our streets. And the trend is continuing this year. So far in 2014, crime is down 29% year-to-date. That equates to 150 fewer victims this year versus last year at this time... New data driven techniques have also contributed to these declines including the use of a risk based deployment forecasting program from Santa Cruz-based PredPol, Inc. a predictive policing software firm; investigative analysis software designed by Palantir, another silicon valley company and real time data visualization and analysis tools from a partnership between LAPD, the Los Angeles County Sheriff and a San Diego-based tech company called the Omega Group.

It\\'s called PREDPOL, short for predictive policing. Assistant  Police Chief Pete Cribbin said the software promises to predict with high probability where the next crime will occur. \"The beauty of this is it really brings it down, really tight, to a 500-square-foot box so it is very clear where you have to be to try to disrupt the activity,\" he said. It\\'s a complex mathematical formula (a similar algorithm is used to predict the geographical patterns of an earthquake) that assigns a probability that a future event will occur based on past events. Five  years of crime statistics have been stored and once the program begins, it will be updated every  three hours with real-time data. So how is PREDPOL different from hot-spot policing?

Here is an excerpt (and full link below): In an age of big data, California police departments are getting in on the action. In Los Angeles, the LAPD now uses software for what it calls \"predictive policing\"--anticipating where crimes are likely to happen before they happen. Outside the LAPD\\'s Foothill Division station, at the northern edge of Los Angeles, police Sgt. Tom Gahry sits in his black-and-white patrol car. He\\'s shuffling through a stack of maps with bright red squares drawn on them \"These squares,\" Gahry explains, pointing to one of the printouts, \"according to the computer system, there\\'s a high probability that a crime will occur within one of those squares.\" Gahry is one of the officers using predictive policing software called PredPol. It takes crime data, runs it through an algorithm, and then generates these maps. The maps tell police where crimes might happen -- before they take place. Police can spend extra time in the areas at risk for crime, the thinking goes, and prevent those crimes from ever occurring. The LAPD says predictive policing has helped reduce crime here in the Foothill Division. This predictive policing software\\'s journey started seven years ago, at UCLA. There, academics and police officers began using math to study crime. One of the postdocs on the project, mathematician George Mohler, discovered an equation that transformed the work. Mohler, who now teaches at Santa Clara University, realized that, mathematically, earthquakes and crime work in a similar way. Mathematical models for predicting earthquake aftershocks could be applied to predict the \"after-crimes\" of an initial incident. According to Mohler\\'s model, one crime sets off a wave of crimes in an area. The equation draws in details from police reports, such as times, locations and types of crimes that already have happened. Mohler explains, \"The idea would be, after that initial report gets filed, then the model says \\'Hey! There\\'s a risk of after-crimes, or aftershocks.\\' And then the police go into that area and they prevent those second and third crimes from occurring - See more at: http://www.californiareport.org/archive/R201309061630/b#sthash.Iw0B5E7j.dpuf',\n",

For the entire article click here. Below we\\'ve included some excerpts of the article written by Ronnie Garrett. Recently a Santa Cruz, Calif. police officer noticed a suspicious subject lurking around parked cars. When the officer attempted to make contact, the subject ran. The officer gave chase; when he caught the subject he learned he was a wanted parolee. Because there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest, the subject was taken to jail. The arrest marks just another day in the life of a police officer out to predict and serve. While officers have long taken an oath to protect and serve, the officer in the above scenario was patrolling the area in question using new technology that enabled him to predict crime hot spots and take action before a crime took place. Though this case casts a public view on the technology\\'s ability to garner arrests, PredPol, named by Time Magazine as one of the Top 50 Inventions of 2011, is actually meant to reduce crime through increased police presence and deterrence, says Zach Friend, a crime analyst with the Santa Cruz PD.\\nWhile arrests occur because officers are in zones the software identified as crime hot spots, Friend explains the software\\'s true utility is in crime deterrence. \"The officer [in the scenario] went into a residential area he normally wouldn\\'t have been in and saw the individual coming out of a car that clearly didn\\'t belong to him and he made an arrest,\" he says. \"But how many people didn\\'t suffer their cars being broken into because of that officer\\'s presence?\" \"PredPol helps reduce crime by increasing police presence.\" The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is the largest police agency to embrace predictive policing, which crunches crime data in real-time to determine where to send officers. To date, the LAPD has implemented the technology in five divisions covering 130 square miles.\\nThe valley\\'s Foothill Division, the first LAPD division to implement the technology, reports results that have turned even the most skeptical of skeptics into believers. \"We saw a 12-percent reduction in targeted crimes during the six-month pilot. And we saw a 26 percent reduction in burglary alone,\" says Capt. Sean Malinowski, who has worked with University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) on the project since it was nothing but a gleam in a mathematician\\'s eye. PredPol is the culmination of a seven-year study by a team of UCLA social sciences and mathematics researchers seeking to study factors that drive crime pattern formation. Anthropology professor Jeff Brantingham says researchers aimed to look into the factors that contribute to crime hot spots.\\nHe explains, \"Crime hot spots are very dynamic. In some areas, hot spots remain constant. But a lot of times [they] come and go, or spread, or go on for awhile and then disappear.\"\\n\"But humans are not nearly as random as we think,\" Brantingham continues. \"Crime is a physical process, and if you can explain how offenders move and how they mix with victims, you can understand an incredible amount.\"',\n",

       " 'Santa Cruz PD\\'s PredPol adds tool for cops, neighbors From the Santa Cruz Sentinel - Aug. 14: By Stephen Baxter: On a day meant to introduce residents to predictive policing hot spots that officers check in their down time, Santa Cruz police Wednesday arrested a man on Beach Street during a predictive check. The day was billed as International Predictive Policing Day of Action, with police in Kent, England, and Los Angeles sharing locations with residents to try to increase their presence on the street and hopefully prevent crime. Near Beach and Main streets about 11:45 a.m., police apprehended a 47-year-old man on suspicion of being drunk in public and carrying a concealed knife, both misdemeanors. Police said it was a small illustration of the idea at work. \"Our goal today is not to arrest a lot of people, it\\'s to prevent the crime from happening,\" said Santa Cruz Police Chief Kevin Vogel. \"I\\'m exceptionally proud that we were the first ones to do this.\" Launched in 2011, the program essentially uses historical data of the time and location of burglaries and thefts and uses an algorithm to predict future crime. When officers are not responding to other calls, they are asked to patrol in those areas. Wednesday, some residents gathered at places such as lower Ocean Street and Lincoln and Chestnut streets, which were predicted to have a higher likelihood of burglary, vehicle burglary or vehicle theft. \"It\\'s almost like Neighborhood Watch in the next century,\" said Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark. Clark said police have not tracked the number of arrests that have come from the \"extra checks,\" as police often call them. Yet he said that once or twice a week, an officer on a predictive policing check has either talked to a suspicious person, received information on another case or made an arrest. The arrests have not been associated with major crimes such as murders or robberies, but they have helped to solve burglaries and put police in places they might not think to patrol. It\\'s been a tool that officers have added to their natural intuition, Clark said. PREDICTIVE EXAMPLES One night in 2012, for instance, officers were on an extra check near Windham Street when they talked to a man who had more than four GPS units on him. \"No one\\'s that lost,\" Clark said. Through more investigation, \"We wrapped up several auto burglary cases off that.\" Last year near North Branciforte and Goss avenues, police stopped a bicyclist and recognized him as a drug user. He wore a NCAA basketball ring and didn\\'t look like a basketball player; police later linked it to a burglary and returned it. Clark\\'s favorite example is that of a Santa Cruz beat cop who was eating his lunch in his patrol car in a downtown parking lot because it was on that shift\\'s predictive list. He spotted two women trying to break into cars and arrested them. For neighborhood leaders like Deborah Elston, the list of 15 predictive policing addresses distributed to neighbors on Wednesday were not a big surprise. They included five areas in the Lower Ocean Street neighborhood, as well as the 100 block of Beach Street and near Seabright Avenue and Murray Street. Elston was pleased that the list was shared with neighbors, and she encouraged residents to be aware of suspicious people and problems like graffiti -- which can lead to more crime. \"When you make the 911 call to report suspicious activity, you never know what you\\'re preventing,\" Elston said. Although many factors go in to crime trends, overall reported crime dropped more than 25 percent in June and July compared with June and July 2012, according to police. For instance, there were 45 reported burglaries in the city in July 2013, down from 67 in July 2012. Elston said she understood it might be difficult to quantify the success of predictive policing because crime could have been prevented by the presence of an officer or neighbor. The person trying door handles on cars to steal things might have gone elsewhere, for instance. Yet she said that twice in the first few months of the predictive program, she had her cellphone out to call 911 for a suspicious person when an officer on an extra check arrived. One time was on the San Lorenzo River levee when an officer rolled up to her. She told him, \"I was just about to call you.\"  ',\n",
       " 'Piedmont, California Civic Organization Highlights PredPol The Piedmont, California Civic Organization penned an article about PredPol\\'s usage in small cities and how it is reducing crime. Here is the article: \"Tight budgets have forced many California cities to reduce the size of Police Departments.  At the same time crime rates are rising. To offset the loss of police officers some cities are turning to Predictive Policing (PredPol), a predictive analytics technology tool developed in California and named one of the \"Best Inventions\" of 2011 by Time magazine. Using the crime date, time and address data already recorded by police departments the software analyzes it and forecasts the time and location for the same crime in the future. Small and medium cities using PredPol --  including Alhambra, Campbell, Los Gatos, Morgan Hill, Salinas and Santa Cruz--are reporting reduced burglaries. The Santa Cruz police personnel decreased by 20% in 2011 while crime increased by 30%.  After the first year using PredPol printouts of predicted hotspots at the start of each shift, Santa Cruz Police reported a 19% reduction in burglaries and added predictions of bike thefts, battery, assault and prowling in late 2012. Putting visible police patrols in the locales at times when burglaries are most likely is thought to be the reason burglaries are prevented.  Predictive Policing is applied to the most frequent crimes in each community and is dependent on the specific crime patterns of each city.  The goal is to make the best use of available police officers.  According to Co.Exist Fast Company, \"Predictive Policing is charging cities based on population, with costs ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per year for the largest cities.\" The Alhambra Police Department explains their decision: \"Developed over a period of six years by cops, mathematicians, criminologists and anthropologists, PredPol is a predictive policing program that looks at burglaries and car thefts and other crimes in a similar manner as predicting aftershocks from an earthquake.  Agencies that have deployed the PredPol tool have seen marked reductions in targeted crimes.  PredPol gives medium sized cities like Alhambra access to complex, large analytic capabilities normally only available to big cities or massive corporations.  The inputs are straightforward: previous crime reports, which include the time and location of a crime.  The software is informed by sociological studies of criminal behavior, which include the insight that burglars often ply the same area.\" Los Angeles experimented with Predictive Policing in just one precinct--Foothill--for six months.  At the end of the trial, the Police Department reported that burglaries in the Foothill precinct decreased 36 percent while crime rose across Los Angeles over the same period. \" http://www.piedmontcivic.org/2013/06/01/predictive-policing-useful-in-small-cities/',\n",

It may seem impossible, but as 7\\'s Carmel Cafiero reports, new technology is \"Predicting Problems\" for one South Florida police force. WSVN -- Before Officer Adam Willson heads out on patrol, he gets some crime tips from his computer. Lauderhill Police Officer Adam Willson: \"This is actually one of the areas.\" The red box on the computer screen is changing the way the Lauderhill Police Department is cracking down on crime. Adam Willson: \"It seems very futuristic, but this is what law enforcement is starting to look at.\" The department is the first in Broward County and one of only a few in all of South Florida to sign on with a new data company called PredPol. Adam Willson: \"After roll call, they\\'ll get in the car and they\\'ll look at the PredPol boxes and they\\'ll see where they have an area of concern and they\\'ll go and patrol that area.\" How does PredPol work? It takes information about crimes that have already been committed here in Lauderhill, mixes it together with a whole bunch of complex computer data and predicts the future. Adam Willson: \"It\\'s almost science fact, in a way. It\\'s proven to work.\" Lauderhill officers get a report from PredPol. It lists areas likely to see crime that day, including the type of crime, location and time of the incident. Adam Willson: \"Every single day, it sends out two different algorithms, one for day shift and one for night shift.\" The data is broken down into several 500-square-foot areas where crimes are likely to happen next. So far, the reports have been pretty accurate. Adam Willson: \"We\\'ve had incidents where they were in their box and we did have calls come in.\" And more importantly for the department, it allows them to put officers in areas where they\\'re needed most. Adam Willson: \"It assisted with getting more resources into that area faster. Assisted with getting the bad guy in custody.\" And that has residents feeling more at ease. Monica Gereke: \"It\\'s perfect. Whatever we can find or police can find to keep us safe.\" The technology doesn\\'t take officers from other areas of the city. They go into their PredPol zones in between calls and during down time to patrol on foot and make their presence known. Adam Willson: \"They\\'ll park the car, like you saw back there, and they\\'ll get out on foot.\" The goal: look at the past to predict problems and create a safer future for everyone. Adam Willson: \"Send a very strong message that we\\'re out here and we\\'re taking a proactive approach.

Here is the link. Copy below: New computer software is helping Norcross police officers patrol the city in a new way, based on historical crime reports, time of day and weather patterns. The software is called Predictive Policing, known simply as Pred-Pol. \"It\\'s predicting the highest probable location so that we can better allocate where our resources are being deployed to,\" said Lt. Bill Grogan of the Norcross Police Department. They paid $6,000 to have the software tailored to their department. The program was developed by a group of professors at UCLA and takes into account the most recent 18 months of local police data, helping officers identify certain areas that are more at risk on some days than others. Some of the areas are known for high crime rates. Others, said Grogan, come as a surprise to officers who normally would not think to spend extra time there looking for criminal activity. \"These areas you may not have thought of,\" said Grogan, referencing a map with small red squares on it, highlighting potentially problematic spots. \"Specifically, the success we had the first day it was implemented was exactly one of those locations, where the officers would not have been there. No doubt about it, their words, they would not have been there had it not been for this prediction.\" On that first day of using Pred-Pol, Aug. 9, Grogan said one of his patrol units was already in one the neighborhoods that had been denoted by a red box. There, they were able to apprehend a suspect while he was in the midst of committing burglary, according to Grogan. \"I was baffled,\" he said. \"I could not have ever anticipated that we would have had such a quick success. And not only that one success, but two in the same day.\" Grogan said his officers will likely only spend a few extra minutes per day in the areas that are marked by the red boxes, which denote areas that are roughly 500 square feet in size.',\n",

Carlsbad officials said last week they recently agreed to start using PredPol software early next year in an effort to reduce crime and deploy the department\\'s 110 officers more effectively. The software is based on the idea that if police can more often be in the right place at the right time, many crimes would get solved while they happen or not take place at all... Using mathematical formulas that can help predict the locations of earthquake aftershocks, PredPol gives police officers maps showing where future crimes are likely to take place. The software combines data about past crimes with universal trends in criminal activity and other information from local police, such as where a set of streetlights has burned out. While virtually all law enforcement agencies study patterns of where and when past crimes occurred, PredPol uses algorithms -- step-by-step mathematical calculations -- to look ahead. \"They\\'re looking at crime through a rearview mirror and we\\'re looking through the front windshield\" said Ryan Coonerty, PredPol\\'s director of government relations and strategy. \"It\\'s been shown to be a little more than twice as effective.\" In the Foothill area of Los Angeles in 2012, more than 6 percent of crimes took place within areas on maps created by PredPol, while only 3 percent happened in locations mapped by Police Department analysts. That year, overall crime was down 12 percent in the Foothill area, with department officials crediting PredPol for part of the drop. Meanwhile, burglaries were down 19 percent when Santa Cruz began using the software in 2012. Coonerty said predictive policing is the next evolution in crime fighting, describing it as an advance similar to community policing in the 1960s and the CompStat system for analyzing past crime data in the 1990s.

       " '\\n\\tPredictive Policing Software Featured in GovTech Magazine PredPol\\'s predictive policing software was featured this week in GovTech Magazine. The magazine featured the Santa Cruz Police Department\\'s usage of the program and the reduction in burglaries after implementation. Here is a copy of the story. It can also be found here.  Burglaries are down in the iconic beach community of Santa Cruz, Calif., and police are crediting the drop in crime to the use of predictive policing technology.  The Santa Cruz Police Department compared crime statistics from the first six months of 2012 to the same timeframe in 2011 when the advanced analytics and prediction technology wasn\\'t being used. Without adding more officers to the streets or changing beats and shift times, the results were a 19 percent reduction in property theft.  Zach Friend, press information officer and crime analyst for the Santa Cruz PD, said the program\\'s success really started being noticed a few months after the department installed the system as a pilot project in July 2011. Crime data is pumped into a database and a complex computer algorithm predicts hotspots around the city where officers can expect illegal activity to occur. Once officers got comfortable using data generated from the sophisticated computer algorithm, crime started going down and some arrests were made because of correct predictions.  For example, in August, an officer was out at 12:30 a.m. driving into a zone that the predictive technology told him to check out. He noticed two people attempting to steal a car and arrested them. Until alerted by the police, the car\\'s owner had no idea the vehicle had been tampered with. Source: Zach Friend, press information officer and crime analyst for the Santa Cruz Police Department \"To me, that\\'s the perfect example of the success of the program -- preventing the crimes before they occur in the first place,\" Friend said.  Predictive policing technology is becoming widespread among local law enforcement agencies in the U.S. Los Angeles and Chicago have been using crime stats and analytic tools for a few years now. Other cities such as Rialto, Calif., are just starting their own programs. The Santa Cruz PD bumped its predictive policing program from an experimental phase to full operation in July 2012. In addition to property theft, the system is now used to predict gang activity and street crimes for specialty units in the department.  When officers in one of the specialty units access the system, they can check off selections to run predictive analyses just in their specific area, without the inclusion of property theft data. While statistics on the accuracy of these predictions aren\\'t available yet, Friend said the predictive technology has been able to focus the efforts of those units even further.  In addition, the system is now automated. When the technology was initially deployed, 10 maps featuring the predictive algorithm\\'s crime hot spot findings were manually generated by Friend on a daily basis. Now 15 maps are produced, and supervisors log in to the system prior to briefings and print out a one-page sheet that lists the predicted crime locations for the day.  The information can be accessed online by any officer and the data is refreshed hourly, giving users almost real-time statistical views. Friend said data generated by the system can be accessed by in-car computers and smartphones, but the department hasn\\'t upgraded its equipment yet so it\\'s unable to accommodate it.  Friend believes technology upgrades are inevitable, however.  \"A lot of the younger officers that are coming up are very adept with technology and have an expectation that the technology they use at home will be used ... on the job,\" Friend said.  \"I think [predictive technology] systems like this will be widely adopted, especially by younger generations of officers that are very comfortable with having data in their cars, having maps and the interactivity,\" he added.  While the predictive crime maps are useful, Friend said there aren\\'t any plans to share them with the public. Although the Santa Cruz PD has been using a mobile app to share maps of overall crime, the department views the predictive data as internal tactical information.',\n",
       " 'Dr. Jeff Brantingham Featured in UCLA Article on PredPol By Sam Hoff  - UCLA Daily Bruin A UCLA anthropology professor studies an unorthodox type of hunter-gatherer - one who forages for unlocked cars and hunts for easily stolen property. Professor Jeffrey Brantingham, who specializes in criminology, uses knowledge of past crimes to determine criminal hot spots and then predict where crimes are likely to occur. \"Criminals are effectively foragers,\" Brantingham said. \"Choosing what car to steal is like choosing which animal to hunt. The same decision-making processes go into both of these choices.\" Brantingham\\'s primary work within the anthropology department at UCLA is in human behavior and evolution, especially foraging and why humans have particular behavioral adaptations. Expanding on this specialty, he helped to develop a software called Predictive Policing, or PredPol, after years of researching crime trends. The program, which Brantingham and colleagues launched in 2011, takes crime data supplied by police forces and applies mathematical formulas similar to those used to study chemical reactions or predict earthquake aftershocks to the data, Brantingham said. PredPol predicts physical areas, marked as 500-square-foot boxes on Google Maps, identifying where crimes such as car thefts and burglaries are likely to happen on a given day, said Sean Malinowski, a captain at the Los Angeles Police Department\\'s Foothill division who works closely with the software. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly using hard data to make both long- and short-term decisions, Andrea Bertozzi, director of applied mathematics, said. The Santa Cruz Police Department first implemented PredPol in July 2011. In a trial of the program in Santa Cruz, burglary rates dropped significantly from the previous year because police were able to better predict where to send patrol cars, Malinowski said. Each patrol car is assigned two of the hot spots every day or night shift in the LAPD program, which they are instructed to patrol more heavily than other areas, Malinowski said. The officers are also asked to spend 15 to 20 minutes in the box, attempting to deter criminals by using methods based on the predicted crime. For instance, if burglaries from motor vehicles are predicted, officers may walk near parked cars, Malinowski said. Brantingham\\'s interest in criminology is a few decades in the making. His parents are well-known criminologists at Simon Fraser University in Canada and he said that conversations about crime that he heard growing up impacted his career path. \"I didn\\'t realize it, but I was accumulating knowledge by osmosis, hearing about crime and criminal behavior while spending time with my parents,\" Brantingham said. Brantingham\\'s idea for PredPol came after years of research alongside UCLA faculty and graduate students about mathematical simulations of crime. Bertozzi worked alongside Brantingham as a fellow principal investigator in a different academic research project that served as a precursor to PredPol. \"We did the heavy lifting on the math side, but it was more of a partnership,\" she said. \"(Brantingham) was really the guy who took our math and applied it to actual crime.\" While the first research project was purely academic, Brantingham said that he found that a crime forecasting tool could be developed to apply his academic findings to a practical setting. In November 2011, LAPD compared the software to predictions from human crime analysts. During the analysis, Malinowski said he observed a 12 percent reduction in crime because of PredPol, including a 25 percent reduction in burglaries. Because of the successful trial run, Brantingham and his associates later officially launched PredPol, which is now implemented in seven divisions of the LAPD as well as other agencies around the world. Analysts tend to skew their data, placing more emphasis on recent crimes. However, the PredPol software takes into account seven years of data, providing more reliable results, Malinowski said. \"PredPol removes the bias and adds a lot more data,\" he said. \"It does a better job of directing officers where to be and when to be there.\" Police officers at the Foothill division were able to curb six to eight crimes per week when using the software, he said. While it could be feasible to extend the program to UCLA\\'s university police, there are special challenges when it comes to crime mapping on college campuses with large, multistory buildings, Brantingham said. \"The way databases are constructed doesn\\'t favor a campus environment,\" he said. As he balances his tenure as a professor and providing expertise at PredPol, Brantingham is expanding his research focus beyond mapping property crimes. Brantingham\\'s newest work in the areas of gang crime, social networking and crime and predicting violent crime further applies his background in anthropology to predict the actions of the urban hunter-gatherer.

Here is an excerpt: The consolidation of data in a common data warehouse such as N-DEx is just the first step in improving nationwide investigations. The next steps involve the use of data mining techniques to predict where and when crime will occur. This sounds like a page from the script of the movie Minority Report, but the objective isn\\'t to arrest people but to anticipate and remove the opportunity to commit crimes before they can occur. \"9-11 triggered a major paradigm shift in the policing world. It had been a response mission. Now it\\'s a prevention mission,\" says Steve Ambrosini, executive director of the IJIS Institute, an industry consortium of vendors of law enforcement software. \"Predictive policing is at the top of a lot of people\\'s lists,\" says Commander Scott Edson of the Los Angeles Police Department, which uses a commercial software program, Coplink, for its incident management database. \"It\\'s something that Coplink and N-DEx will mature into.\" Initiatives are already well underway at the local level in areas such as Los Angeles, where the PredPol algorithm developed by UCLA has been used to analyze seven years of incident information to predict where, within 500 foot by 500 foot areas, or \"predictive boxes,\" certain types of property-related crimes are most likely to occur during an upcoming patrol shift. And then the department can concentrate on those areas during their shifts, or can redeploy police person-power appropriately. In a 2012 pilot phase, the Los Angeles Police Department Foothills area recorded a 25% decrease in burglaries in a six-month period over the previous year, according to Sean Malinowski, commanding officer of the Real-time Analysis and Critical Response division. \"The idea is to prevent crime.\" Mathematicians developed the model based on an algorithm that\\'s used to predict earthquakes, says Jeffrey Brantingham, chief of research and development at PredPol, a startup formed to market software that uses the PredPol algorithm to make predictions about where crimes are most likely to occur during a patrol shift to other police departments. Like earthquakes, crime occurs along certain fault lines, and events tend to cluster together into a predictable pattern. Work now is expanding beyond car theft, burglary, and burglary from a vehicle, which represent 65% of all crimes, to predict other crimes that fall under the FBI\\'s Part 1 classification, including robbery, rape, assaults and homicide. The Seattle Police Department, another early user of PredPol, started out with property crime predictions, which rolled out to all five of its precincts in May... Since implementing a similar predictive policing system four years ago, the City of Richmond, Va. has seen a significant reduction in all violent crimes and property-based crimes. The results were so good, in fact, that police chief Rodney Monroe implemented a similar system soon after taking on his current position as chief of police in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C...

The article, written by Josh Green, can be seen here  - or read below: It was more than intuition that drew a Norcross police officer to an extended-stay hotel. A computer program in her police cruiser had advised her to scope out that very hotel, at that very hour. When she arrived, she spotted a suspicious-looking man. Turns out, the man was on the lam, living at the hotel but wanted in Illinois on warrants stemming from burglary charges, officials said. \"He would eventually have been doing something wrong in Norcross,\" said Warren Summers, the city\\'s police chief. But the hotel resident never got the chance. His was just one of several arrests made within the first twenty-four hours after Norcross rolled out new security software on August 8. The technology is, depending on your perspective, either a super creepy form of snooping or a highly effective crime deterrent. Norcross became the first police department in Georgia to launch a real-time crime prediction tool from a company called PredPol (short for \"predictive policing\"). Using the same concepts retailers like Amazon and Target rely on to chart consumer behavior, the police program uses existing crime data (location, type of crime, dates, times, etc.) to form algorithms that lead police to where specific crimes are most likely to occur. It may sound farfetched--or like a plot device in a science-fiction thriller--but Chief Summers, for one, is sold. Norcross cops credit the program with helping officers snare several suspects the first day--including the absconder from Illinois and two alleged burglars, who Summers said were caught red-handed in a house that fell within a 500 square-foot \"predictive box\" for misdeeds identified by the PredPol algorithms. A team of mathematicians and social scientists developed PredPol at three California universities over the past six years. Since its launch in 2011, departments from Santa Cruz to Columbia, South Carolina have adopted the technology. For now, PredPol helps Norcross officers target theft-related crimes such as robbery and burglary, as opposed to homicides or domestic disputes. The department is paying for the program with seized drug money. Elsewhere in the metro area, the Atlanta Police Department started a ninety-day PredPol pilot program in July. Department spokesman Carlos Campos said APD would launch the program in the fall, if they deem the pilot a success. All thirty Norcross patrol cars have access to PredPol via onboard laptops. Officers have been trained to patrol the \"predictive boxes\" frequently. \"You may displace crime just by being there,\" Summers said. \"The ultimate goal is not only to catch people but prevent crime.\" - See more at: http://www.atlantamagazine.com/agenda/2013/08/19/norcross-police-roll-out-predpol-crime-predicting-technology#sthash.ad7ursMx.dpuf',\n",

       " ' Seattle Police Launch PredPol Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and Seattle Police Chief John Diaz announced the launch of PredPol in Seattle at a press conference this week. According to an article about the launch, \"the software allows SPD to do a deep analysis of past crime data, and forecast possible locations where crimes might occur in the city, down to a 500-foot geographic area. With that information in hand, officers can spend more time pro-actively patrolling those areas when they\\'re not responding to 911 calls. SPD has already deployed the new Predictive Policing software--which is part of the 20/20 policing initiative--in the East and Southwest Precincts, and should be in place in the rest of the department\\'s precincts by April 2013.\"',\n",
       " 'Predictive Policing in Santa Cruz Leads to 19 Percent Drop in Burglaries Faced with declining budgets and greater demands for service police departments are looking for tools that help deploy resources more effectively. One major resource emerging for law enforcement is predictive policing - spearheaded by a new California-based company called PredPol. Dr. Brantingham, who helped design the PredPol predictive policing model, claims that the data is derived from criminal behaviors, including repeat victimization, and the notion that criminals tend to stick near areas they know best. The success of the PredPol system has led LAPD to expand the effort to other divisions. Santa Cruz Police are expanding the programs scope to include some types of violent crimes and additional property crimes including bike thefts, theft from vehicles and even some drug-related crimes. Last week PredPol was adopted by the Morgan Hill, California Police Department and already police have arrested six people on suspicion of various drug crimes. Over 200 agencies have reached out to PredPol about implementing the program.',\n",
       " 'IT World Canada Features PredPol Imagine thwarting a crime even before it occurs by predicting when and where it will happen. Shades of the 2002 Tom Cruise futuristic action thriller Minority Report? Well, in a way yes. No \\'precogs\" are being tethered to a computer yet, but some police agencies south of the border are experimenting with analytics technologies and what is being called predictive policing. For example, for the last seven years the PredPol algorithm developed by a team of mathematicians and social scientists at the University of Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Santa Clara and UC Irvine, has been analyzing crime incident information to some members of the Los Angeles Police predict where certain types of property-related crimes are most likely to happen during certain police patrol shifts. Similar experiments in police precincts in New York and Boston using other technologies have also been carried out. As the PredPol Web site states, its mission is simple: \"Place officers at the right time and location to them the best chance of preventing crime. The technology is designed to predict where crimes are likely to occur in place-based \"prediction boxes\" as small as 500\\' x 500\\'. PredPol is a secure, cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform. Crime data, specific to crime type and specific to police shifts is mapped into it instantaneously as the information is reported to the system. Its developers say PredPol is built around the same technology used to predict earthquakes. Crimes, they said, occur along fault line and happen in predictable patterns much like earthquakes. The PredPol report is shared is distributed to police during the roll call and call also be delivered to officers in the form of a paper report on transmitted to their smart phones or tablet devices. While traditional crime analysis tools such as ComStat provide a \"rear view mirror policing\" by mapping past crime to come up with \"some hints at the future,\" PredPol tells the police where crime is likely to happen in the near future. For example, the model can actually predict the risk of a crime in one location for the next 10 to 12 hours even if the latest crime reported occurred in a different location, according to users.

       " 'PredPol Launches First-Of-Its-Kind Technology to Predict Gun Violence PredPol, the Predictive Policing Company, has developed and is deploying first-of-its-kind technology to help police predict and deter gun violence.  \"We are pleased to be working with innovative leaders in our partner cities,\" said Dr. George Mohler, PredPol co-founder and professor of mathematics and computer science at Santa Clara University.  \"While no single strategy can end gun violence, predictive policing gives officers a significantly better idea of when and where to be so that they can deter crime generally, and gun violence in particular.  If we can prevent just one gun crime, that will mean one less neighbor, friend, or family member who becomes a victim.\" PredPol\\'s unique gun violence prediction methodology leverages existing crime data that every city already has, advanced mathematics developed over more than six years, computer learning, cloud computing, and the indispensable experience of veteran police.  The crime data is analyzed through a sophisticated algorithm that applies proven criminal theories about crime in general and gun violence in particular.  The results are more accurate and more actionable recommendations for when and where gun violence is most likely to occur, thus allowing police to show up before  crime happens. PredPol has extensively modeled this new approach to deterring gun violence, predicting a greater number of gun homicides compared with existing approaches, including traditional hotspot maps. PredPol successfully outperforms current best practices by 66%. This corresponds with even stronger performance that police agencies have seen with PredPol\\'s broader technology for predicting and preventing other violent crimes and property offenses.  In deployments to patrol officers in cities like Los Angeles and Kent, England, PredPol\\'s predictions not only reduced crime but were 100% more  accurate than existing best practices - predicting double the number of crimes as current crime mapping and hotspot analysis. PredPol has already deployed its broad crime prediction tool for less violent crimes and for property offenses in cities like Los Angeles and Santa Cruz in California, South Carolina\\'s capital city of Columbia, Seattle and Tacoma in Washington, and in Kent, England.  The gun violence prediction technology is part of this broader predictive policing technology package. \"We understand the challenges faced by city leaders and law enforcement and created this technology with police to help them do more with less,\" said Dr. Jeff Brantingham, co-founder of PredPol and a criminology expert at UCLA. \"Affordable, easy to use technologies allow police who have tight budgets and limited hiring ability to better direct the patrol resources they have.\"',\n",

       " \"The Creation of PredPol: The Predictive Policing Company About one year after the Santa Cruz Police Department piloted a new beta predictive policing software developed by a team of mathematicians, the company PredPol was formed to meet the demand from law enforcement agencies throughout the country. Today we sat down with company CEO Caleb Baskin, a managing partner of a law firm and one of the founders of the nation's largest co-working business NextSpace Co-Working and Innovation to ask him some questions about the company. Why did you think there was a need to create a company?  Mr. Baskin: The response from agencies around the country and around the world to the research and trials in Santa Cruz and Los Angeles was tremendous.  These two agencies were inundated with hundreds of inquiries from law enforcement personnel seeking to get access to this new tool.  That demand simply could not be met within the framework of the academic experiment being conducted by Dr. Mohler and Dr. Brantingham.  Building a company, which could make this Software as a Service available to any agency that needs it, was the only responsible thing to do. Dr. Mohler and Dr. Brantingham continue to test and improve the software to ensure we are providing the most accurate, scientifically-tested product at a price that cash-strapped agencies can afford. What are the main goals of the company?   Mr. Baskin: PredPol's goal is to provide intuitive and effective tools that let law enforcement agencies predict crime in real time, before it occurs.  We are leveraging the cloud to do this at a price point that is affordable to all agencies, large or small.  Cutting edge technology and science have a crucial roll to play in public safety (and other sectors of government) and PredPol is making those tools available to agencies now. It's important that smaller cities have access to big time analytics and this program provides that. How is this different from other products on the market?  Mr. Baskin: PredPol is the only tool that tells agencies where and when crime is likely to occur, down to a micro-place location only 500 feet by 500 feet, in real time.  These aren't heat maps or other forms of data visualization.  PredPol generates specific, precise actionable intelligence that agencies can use to deploy their limited resources in the most effective manner possible. This was created and tested jointly by cops and professors. This is public service oriented. We believe in our product and know that it can reduce crime so we are enthusastic about providing it at a fair price for cities large and small.

       " 'SacBee Online - PredPol Results in \"Dramatic Crime Reduction\" Cities that have implemented PredPol, a computer software program that predicts when and where crime will occur, have seen \"cliff-like\" drops in crime often within months of deployment. PredPol is a secure, cloud-based software-as-a-service, developed by a team of PhD mathematicians, criminologists, and social scientists at UCLA, Santa Clara University, and UC Irvine in close collaboration with crime analysts and line level officers at the Los Angeles and Santa Cruz Police Departments. In just six months after launch, those first two cities saw crime reductions of 12% to 25% in burglaries and auto thefts compared to the previous Since that time, targeted crimes have continued to drop in Los Angeles, Santa Cruz and in numerous other agencies that have deployed the technology. \"I\\'m convinced that predictive policing works,\" LAPD Captain Sean Malinowski told NBC Southern California. A study of crime data going back 80 months shows a \"cliff-like drop\" when predictive policing began, according to Captain Malinowski. After these successful initial deployments PredPol has deployed its groundbreaking technology in dozens of cities around the United States as well as the United Kingdom. In Alhambra, California, police are using PredPol to target three primary crime types: car theft, theft from vehicles and auto burglary. Since deployment, those crimes have gone down by 7 percent, 20 percent and 32 percent respectively. \"PredPol is an invaluable added tool that allows our police force to use their patrol time more efficiently and helps stop crime before it happens,\" Alhambra Chief Mark Yokoyama told the Global Times. \"This technology offers an excellent crime-fighting solution that will ultimately make Alhambra safer.\" PredPol\\'s core technology has grown from success with property crimes to include prediction of drug crime, gang crime, anti-social behavior, and the recently released gun violence prediction tool. Kent Police in England have watched as violent crime has dropped by 6 percent since they began using PredPol\\'s tool and now the Seattle Police Department have partnered with PredPol to predict and deter gun violence. Dr. George Mohler, PredPol co-founder and professor of mathematics and computer science atSanta Clara University noted that, \"while no single strategy can end gun violence, predictive policing gives officers a significantly better idea of when and where to be so that they can deter crime. If we can prevent just one gun crime, that will mean one less neighbor, friend, or family member who becomes a victim.\" PredPol\\'s unique crime prediction methodology leverages existing crime data that every city already has, advanced mathematics developed over more than six years, computer learning, cloud computing, and the indispensable experience of veteran police.

Without predictive analytics, police are forced to chase yesterday\\'s crime by relying on simple mapping of past crime data. It would be like forecasting the weather using only historical weather patterns, but ignoring weather radar.  Traditional crime mapping tools are calibrated less frequently, rely more on humans to recognize patterns, and allocate resources based on past crimes rather than predicted future offenses. PredPol does not replace the insights of veteran officers and crime analysts, but delivers an easy-to-use enhancement that lets police do more with their current resources.  ']"

       "['PredPol Atlanta Crime Rate Reduced by 19% We\\'re proud to share this story about Atlanta Police Department\\'s success in reducing their crime rate by 19 percent since 2010, and they attribute its sustained reduction to using PredPol\\'s predictive policing technology:   Aggregate crime decreased by 7% and 9% in the two areas that first deployed PredPol in July 2013. Of the four zones where PredPol was not deployed, crime rates increased by 4% - 9% in three and remained flat in one. Due to these successful results, the Atlanta Police Department decided to implement PredPol citywide in November 2013. Atlanta Police Department Chief George Turner (WSB - TV 2 Atlanta, 9/19/13): \"It makes us smarter. It puts us on the cutting edge in what\\'s going on in this country in crime fighting.\" Atlanta Police Chief George Turner (Police Chief Magazine \"Technology Talk\" column) \"We pride ourselves on being a department that is not satisfied with the status quo. We are forward-looking, with a strategic view grounded in innovation. We know the PredPol technology has helped us get smarter on our fight against crime.\" Atlanta Police Department Officer Omari Price (WSB - TV 2 Atlanta, September 19, 2013): \"Since its inception, crime has dropped on my beat. Its like the perfect ally. It really is - it feels like a sidekick that\\'s already looking ahead of you.\" Using advanced mathematics and computer learning, PredPol\\'s algorithms predict many types of crime, including property crimes, drug incidents, gang activity, and gun violence as well as traffic accidents. Only three pieces of data are used to make predictions - type of crime, place of crime, and time of crime. No personal data is utilized in making these predictions.',\n",
       " \"Why PredPol Is Not Like Minority Report Too often when people hear the phrase predictive policing, they think of the film Minority Report. In the film, crimes are predicted by a group of clairvoyants, and individuals are arrested on the basis that they will commit the crime. But PredPol is nothing like Minority Report. First, PredPol predicts where and when a crime is most likely to occur, not who is likely to commit a crime. Because no personal data, information about individuals or demographics are utilized in making these predictions, PredPol's technology does not pose any personal privacy or profiling concerns. Next, predictions are made using a unique algorithm based on three simple data points: Place, time and date of past crimes. This data exists to efficiently guide law enforcement patrols and lower crime through intelligent, community policing methods. PredPol's most successful deployment results occur when agencies advise patrol to maintain visibility in predicted areas as they respond to daily calls. Finally, the patterns inherent in the crimes themselves provide ample information to predict which places and windows of time are at highest risk for future crimes. This is the basic theory of predictive policing: a lot of crime is not random. For example, home burglaries are relatively predictable. When a house gets robbed, the likelihood of that house or houses near it getting robbed again spikes in the following days.

       " 'Predictive Policing Technology Dramatically Reducing Crime in Large & Small Communities Across U.S. & Overseas Santa Cruz, California -- Communities across the United States and overseas are experiencing dramatic reductions in crime -- thanks in large part to PredPol, predictive policing technology that is helping law enforcement prevent crime before it occurs. \"Most importantly, double digit reductions in crime ensure that fewer people become victims,\" said PredPol CEO Larry Samuels, \"and they also result in more efficient deployment of finite policing resources and tremendous cost savings to our communities.\" PredPol predicts where and when a crime is most likely to occur, not who is likely to commit a crime. Because no personal data, information about individuals or demographics are utilized in making these predictions, PredPol\\'s law enforcement technology does not pose any personal privacy or profiling concerns. For example: PredPol supports officers and analysts in predicting crimes that include property crimes, drug incidents, gang activity, gun violence, and even traffic accidents. A unique algorithm analyzes only three simple data points: place, time and date of past crimes. The patterns inherent in the crimes themselves provide ample information to predict which places and windows of time are at highest risk for future crimes. PredPol provides law enforcement agencies with affordable, customized crime predictions for localized areas - 500 feet by 500 feet boxes on maps. Once police and analysts make decisions about which crimes and missions are priorities, maps are automatically generated for each shift of a particular day. Typically, patrol officers spend a few minutes in PredPol boxes to strengthen community ties and deter crime when they\\'re not responding to calls for service or performing other duties. Some of these boxes are in places that officers routinely cover, but many PredPol prediction boxes are in places that might not otherwise receive attention.',\n",
       " 'PredPol Featured on NBC Chicago Story by: Phil Rodgers Chicago police have successfully put a dent in what was a soaring murder rate in 2012 by flooding problem areas with officers and an overtime bill that topped $90 million this year. But what if a police department could fight crime with existing manpower by knowing where crimes are going to happen before they happen? Science fiction, or fact? To a company called PredPol in Los Angeles, it is very much a reality. The company\\'s computer systems generate maps with tiny red boxes which they say are the most likely locations where crimes are about to occur. \"The box is saying, \\'Here\\'s a location where the risk of crime is greater today, than any place else on the landscape,\\'\" explained UCLA professor Jeff Brantingham, one of PredPol\\'s founders. \"You can spend five minutes here and have a better chance of disrupting crime than being anywhere else, even if there\\'s other places that had crimes yesterday or the day before.\" Indeed, PredPol\\'s researchers say they have found that hitting spots where crime occurred a day earlier may not be the wisest strategy. PredPol crunches 10 years of crime data and current statistics, which may have been generated in the preceding few hours, to generate its own predictions of the exact locations where police are most needed. And those boxes are small: just 500 feet square. That\\'s about the size of a single apartment complex, or a shopping center parking lot. \"It\\'s ok to be skeptical,\" Brantingham says, \"because predictive policing sounds like it doesn\\'t work.\" But PredPol\\'s researchers, and in fact, its users, say it does work. It uses a complicated algorithm originally written to predict earthquakes to make the deployment of patrol officers as precise as possible. \"This is straight out mathematics,\" says Los Angeles Captain Sean Malinowksi, who helped develop PredPol and helmed a six month pilot program in the Foothill District on L.A.\\'s northeast side. \"We had a 25 percent decrease in burglary for that six months, versus that same six months a year ago,\" Malinowski said. \"And overall, we had a 12 percent reduction in the targeted crimes.\" Not only does PredPol sound like something out of the movies, it also goes against the traditional law enforcement methods of keeping score. And Malinowski said that means a change in the expectations of officers on the street. \"While your whole career you\\'ve been credited for big arrests,\" Malinowski notes, \"we\\'d like you to turn that a little bit on its head and prevent the crime from occurring in the first place.\" \"The outcome for us is lower crime, not number of arrests made,\" he said. Right now, Los Angeles is only using PredPol for property crimes. It has recently been rolled out in Seattle and Atlanta as well. But the program\\'s creators say they believe it can be just as effective in predicting violent crimes, including murder. \"Surprisingly enough, gun crime is just as predictable as property crimes,\" Brantingham says. Chicago is not a client. But PredPol\\'s founders ran Chicago crime data as an exercise. Thousands of pieces of information on gun seizures, assaults, batteries, robberies, and murders were fed in. And they say the results were impressive. Using PredPol boxes covering about 10 percent of the city, the program accurately predicted more than half of the murders which actually occurred. The researchers concede that\\'s a high coverage area. By contrast, Los Angeles only generates about 20 of the tiny boxes per district. Still, Brantingham says the seeming randomness of a passion-driven crime like murder can be predicted. \"Even though it seems to be random to the victims, it\\'s not random at all,\" he says. \"You can still predict two to two-and-a-half times more gun crime using this than what you would be able to do with existing practice.\" Closer to home, police in suburban Elgin have been using PredPol, mostly for property crimes, since the first of the year. A spokesman said the department has not yet quantified numbers on its performance. But in Los Angeles, what was a pilot program has now been rolled out citywide. \"When you drive a black and white through a PredPol box, you can assume that you are likely seeing the bad guy,\" says L.A. Captain John Romero. \"And the bad guy is seeing you.\" A Chicago Police Department spokesman said while they are not using the technology, they do employ other methods to try to stay ahead of violent crimes. \"We are engaged in several predictive efforts, including two funded through the National Institute of Justice,\" said spokesman Adam Collins. \"It\\'s a predictive analytic data set that tells us who is most likely to be involved in a violent crime, either as a victim or offender, based on their criminal history and their criminal network.\" \"We use this list to make those individuals aware of their significantly higher likelihood of being involved in violence,\" he said. \"Make them aware of the fact that they are eligible for enhanced penalties due to their background, and also work to help get them out of a life of violence.\"',\n",
       " \"Law Enforcement Technology Innovation in Atlanta Our partners at the Atlanta Police Department (APD) have once again made news for being innovators within the law enforcement technology space. According to an article in American City and County, APD has streamlined data analysis using Google's Search Appliance. From the article: Using Google Search Appliance, Search360 has indexed more than 160 million records. Users can now simultaneously search across multiple databases, saving time and resources. Search360 also uses Google Maps to plot 911 calls, allowing APD's physical security information management to pull up those security cameras closest to the crime. Plotting also allows officers see patterns and clusters of criminal activity. PredPol is proud to partner with APD and provide our predictive policing services in conjunction with their forward-thinking strategy to reduce crime. Atlanta Chief Turner has recently stated that using PredPol, APD has been able to reduce crime by 20%.

       " 'Defining Predictive Policing Predictive policing has become a widely discussed phrase in the last few years, sometimes being used so broadly and for so many technologies that the real performance features and technical specifications get lost. This post seeks to succinctly establish parameters for a current definition of what predictive policing is. Predictive policing has become a widely discussed phrase in the last few years, sometimes being used so broadly and for so many technologies that the real performance features and technical specifications get lost. This post seeks to succinctly establish parameters for a current definition of what predictive policing is.  Predictive policing tries to harness the power of information, geospatial technologies and evidence-based intervention models to reduce crime and improve public safety. This two-pronged approach -- applying advanced analytics to various data sets, in conjunction with intervention models -- can move law enforcement from reacting to crimes into the realm of predicting what and where something is likely to happen and deploying resources accordingly. The National Institute of Justice, the research, development and evaluation agency of the United States Department of Justice, notes that law enforcement work is frequently reactive: officers respond to calls for service, quell disturbances and make arrests. In contrast, notes the NIJ, proactive policing uses data, geospatial models, and intervention models to predict what and where [and when] something is likely to happen and to deploy resources accordingly. Very importantly, the NIJ explains, \"The predictive policing approach does not replace traditional policing. Instead, it enhances existing approaches such as problem-oriented policing, community policing, intelligence-led policing and hot spot policing.\" While crime may afflict the same neighborhoods year after year, the day-to-day fluctuations in where and when crimes occur are large. Extensive research has shown that day-to-day crime patterns are the result of: Each of these processes is well known empirically, but when put together, their impact on how crime hotspots emerge, spread, and disappear is incredibly complex. This makes predictions for where crime will occur in the next 10-12 hours very difficult. The application of analytical techniques, particularly quantitative techniques, to identify promising targets for police intervention with the goal of reducing crime risk by preventing future crimes or solving past crimes. (source) Developments in mathematical and statistical modeling, high-performance cloud computing, and GPS-enabled mobile devices now make it possible for frequently updated crime forecasts to be at the disposal of officers in the field. Knowledge, skills, and experience are essential and indispensable. They can reliably direct officers to the top two or three riskiest locations in their operational environment for any particular shift on any particular day. It is much harder and time-consuming, though, for law enforcement to identify and choose between a few dozen locations where risk might be lower and is highly variable from day to day. Opportunities to disrupt crime in these places are missed and thus crime prevention and reduction becomes unnecessarily difficult. Chronic hotspots are long term in duration and necessitate problem-oriented policing strategies to address the root causes of crime. Temporary hotspots, on the other hand, last on the time scale of days to weeks. Using high-powered mathematics and near real time crime data housed in a department\\'s RMS, yesterday\\'s crime can be evaluated in the context of all crimes occurring over a long horizon and wide spatial fields to calculate accurate probabilities for where and when crime will occur today. Within these parameters, predictive policing can help law enforcement agencies intelligently inform patrol officers of where and when crime may occur, allowing them to effectively prevent crime. A minimal amount of data is needed to go beyond traditional \"hotspot\" mapping and define predictive policing.',\n",
       " '5 Common Myths about Predictive Policing While the term \"predictive policing\" has been in use for years, the growth of our software and reliance upon it has given us insight into common myths regarding its definition. This post examines 5 myths about predictive policing, discovered through recurring questions that relate to predictive policing using PredPol\\'s technology. Much of modern law enforcement strategy and technology is based on the CompStat process, which enforces principles of tracking and rapidly responding to crime in an organized manner. Predictive policing is not simply faster reactive policing where patrol officers responding to a crime receive information in the field from many different sources very quickly. Although predictive policing owes its roots to the CompStat process, its goal is to prevent crimes from happening, not responding to them faster. Predictive policing is more than traditional hotspot mapping that simply maps past crimes to make judgments about future crimes. While hotspots and heatmaps are a minimally acceptable way to allocate limited police resources, it is only half as accurate as actual forecasting technology that includes high level mathematics, machine learning, and proven theories of crime behavior. In fact, a 6 month randomized controlled trial found that crime analysts using PredPol technology in addition to their existing tools are twice as effective as experienced crime analysts using hotspot mapping alone. Predictive policing does predict that a crime will happen in the microplace prediction areas, but provides the locations that are at highest risk of a crime occurring during the prescribed window of time. The presence of police officers in the prediction areas creates a deterrence and suppression effect, thus preventing crime in the first place. Because PredPol does not collect, upload, analyze or in any way involve any information about individuals or populations and their characteristics - PredPol\\'s software technology does not pose any personal privacy or profiling concerns.  The algorithm uses advanced mathematics and computer learning to generate predictions using only three pieces of data - type, place, and time - of past crimes. Patterns inherent in the crimes themselves provide ample information on where and when crimes are likely to occur in the future. For example, if one house on a block is burglarized, there is a higher likelihood that other houses in the neighborhood will also be at risk for burglary. Law enforcement often assumes that this cutting edge technology is very expensive, requires new hiring, and means big hardware costs.  None of this is needed. PredPol can be set up to work with a Department\\'s own technology within weeks and generates actionable predictions for each shift in one tap or click. PredPol information can be printed or accessed securely through computers or mobile devices in patrol cars and in the field. The annual subscription cost is straightforward, based on population served rather than amount of crime or number of users. Law enforcement agencies using PredPol have no new hardware to buy, no new hires to make, and no limit on the number of law enforcement users or  updates.

The 38th annual conference, held this year in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has featured a number of outstanding speakers and events. To learn more about NOBLE click here. Created by police for police, PredPol's patent-pending technology generates predictions about which areas and windows of time are at highest risk for future crimes. PredPol reports on property crimes, traffic accidents, drug incidents, gang activity, and gun violence. Predictions mapped to 500-by-500 foot areas using three pieces of data -- type of crime, place of crime, and time of crime -- thus avoiding profiling and privacy concerns. Patrol officers spend a few minutes in these boxes to deter and prevent crime when they're not responding to calls for service or performing other duties. The goal is better allocation of finite resources and, ultimately, crime prevention that saves a police department and city tremendous amounts of money -- more than 10 times the price of the software technology. Most importantly, predictive policing works, with a proven track record in cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Orange County, Florida, plus many agencies in Northern California. In contrast to hotspot analysis that simply maps past crime data, PredPol's first-of-its-kind technology applies advanced mathematics and computer learning that forecasts twice as many crimes as those made by current best practices.\",\n",
       " '\\n\\tKent Police Use PredPol To Prevent Violent Crime The Kent Police Department used PredPol for a \"weekend blitz\" to prevent violent crime according to the Kent News. Here is the article: Kent Police is continuing its summer blitz on violent crime and made a further 138 arrests during last weekend. Using the force\\'s predictive policing data, officers patrolled the county\\'s town centres between Friday, August 2, and Sunday, August 4, where historically violent crime has been an issue. Asst Chf Cons Rob Price said: \"We are continuing to crack down on violent crime in the county. Summer months traditionally show an increase in violence on the streets and our officers are being placed around the county to arrest anyone who carries out this type of offence. \"Using our predictive policing data, and increasing visibility at these locations, we want to deter those who think of carrying out violent offences and ensure everyone has a safe night out... Officers also arrested 126 people on suspicion of violence the previous weekend - from Friday, July 26 to Sunday, July 28.',\n",
       " 'Predictive Policing and Crime Displacement This post addresses the myth of crime displacement, which simply describes the expectation that crime moves from one area to another due to police prevention efforts. Some might think that if law enforcement\\'s crime prevention efforts are helping to deter crime in one area, that criminals will commit those crimes elsewhere. The research shows otherwise. When data-driven patrol takes away crime opportunities, most offenders opt to not commit the crime. Studies on criminology show that criminals often offend in the places where they are most comfortable. If there is repeated police deterrence, it reduces their willingness to offend in that location. They weigh the options and much of the time, will not relocate or think of the opportunities in another location as good. Several other criminology studies disprove displacement theory - many dating as far back as 1993. A recent, National Institute of Justice study stated that, \"quantitative measures offer strong support for prior studies that show that focused crime prevention efforts are not likely to have large displacement effects to areas nearby. In this sense, crime does not seem to simply \"move around the corner\" as a result of hot spot policing efforts.\" Using data about where and when crimes have been committed in the past, PredPol provides patrol officers predictions that give them the best chance of denying opportunities for future crimes to occur, shift by shift. PredPol\\'s most recent study was conducted by the Atlanta Police Foundation after a predictive policing trial in 2013. Atlanta was broken up into six different policing \\'Zones\\' and different Part 1 crime types were used to measure PredPol\\'s predictive accuracy, crime reduction results, and effects on crime displacement. These charts show the average percentage of burglary & robbery crime within x distance from a PredPol box. The first rows display the 4 zones that were not deploying PredPol during the trial. The second rows display the 2 zones where PredPol was deployed:  According to crime displacement theory, crime within x distance from a PredPol box in the 2 zones where PredPol is deployed should be higher than in the non-deployed zones, because PredPol is shifting crime \"around the corner\".',\n",
       " 'PredPol in Reading, PA Results Reading Police Attribute Drop in Burglaries to New Strategies Taken from this WFMZ article reported on December 17, 2014. READING, Pa. - Despite a double-digit drop in the number of officers on the force, Reading police have seen a double-digit drop in burglaries throughout the city. New policing strategies implemented by the RPD over the last year have contributed to a 23 percent drop in burglaries, according to Chief Bill Heim. The department, Heim said, has combined predictive policing data with its existing crime-mapping system, allowing it to shift officers\\' efforts from places that have experience crime to areas where the next crime was predicted to occur. \"With almost 100,000 residents, we need to be doing everything we can to keep Reading residents safer,\" Heim said. \"We\\'ve lost over 45 officer positions due to financial constraints but have gained this invaluable tool.\" The RPD began using predictive policing software, called PredPol, in October 2013 to help it identify where to strategically deploy officers in the places and at the times crime is most likely to occur. Using a unique algorithm, PredPol provides Reading crime analysts and officers with customized \"boxes\" on maps of the city, identifying the 500-by-500-foot areas where the highest probability exists for a crime to occur, explained Heim, adding that the boxes are automatically generated for each shift of each day. \"We\\'ve been tracking the number of times our officers patrol inside the PredPol boxes. Their presence really helps deter crime,\" Heim remarked. \"It\\'s shown itself to be a real force-multiplier in crime prevention.\" The chief noted that some of the boxes represent places that officers routinely cover, but many others are places that might not otherwise receive attention.

       " 'Modesto Sees Double-Digit Drop in Property Crime with PredPol Taken from http://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/article3790616.html Modesto police officials say they\\'ve seen a double-digit drop in burglaries, robberies and vehicle thefts in the past 10 months, and they credit the department\\'s new policing strategies for the city\\'s lowest property crime rates in three years. Modesto sees double-digit drop in property crimes - lowest in three years http://t.co/xqoiOcWk2Y -- The Modesto Bee (@modbee) November 12, 2014 This year, Modesto has had a 20 percent reduction in home burglaries, a 13 percent reduction in commercial thefts, a 12 percent reduction in vehicle thefts, an 11 percent reduction in robberies and a 5 percent reduction in larceny. \"We are determined to drive down crime in Modesto by being more strategic with our resources and more engaged with our community, despite the fact that we\\'ve had a 25percent reduction in patrol staff and hefty budget cuts over the last year,\" said Police Chief Galen Carroll in a news release. The department has been using predictive policing data, trying to learn about areas hit by crime and when to patrol those areas. Police have combined that predictive policing with improving dialogue with Modesto residents through one-on-one conversations, social media and town hall meetings. The predictive policing software uses statistics and mathematical modeling to predict where crimes are likely to occur, down to an area as small as 500 by 500 feet. The software also is being used in such cities as Seattle and Los Angeles. \"With fewer resources at our disposal, we are fortunate to be able to better pinpoint where crime is likely to occur,\" Capt. Rick Armendariz said in the news release. \"We are finding we are now more often in the right place at the right time.\" The department began using the predictive policing software, called PredPol, in January. Police officials wanted to identify where to strategically deploy officers in the places and at the times crimes are most likely to occur. The software helps analysts and officers determine areas with the highest probability of a crime occurring, using an algorithm based on the location, time and date of past crimes. Police officials said it does not include any information about individuals or demographic groups. Jeff Brantingham is a co-founder of PredPol and an anthropology professor specializing in criminology at UCLA. He said in the news release that there is no single strategy that can eliminate crime altogether, but dozens of cities in the country are using predictive analytics to reduce crime and improve safety. \"We\\'re pleased, but not surprised with the results, as they are mirroring what we are seeing in other communities across the nation,\" Brantingham said about the recent decline in Modesto crime.',\n",
       " 'Predictive Policing with Continued Results Law Enforcement agencies using PredPol\\'s predictive policing software continue to report crime reduction results in every region it is deployed. Using only three pieces of crime data -- what, when, and where crime occurred -- communities actively using PredPol have confirmed positive change. In Modesto, California, reported crime has shown decreases in home burglaries of 20%, commercial thefts reduced 13%, vehicle thefts down 12%, and robberies reduced 11%. PredPol has acted as a force multiplier for Modesto, aiding in crime reductions while their patrol staff and budgets were significantly reduced. Across the country in Reading, Pennsylvania, similar predictive policing results have been reported. Reading\\'s Police Department has seen reductions in burglaries of 18%, and auto thefts reduced as much as 30% since using PredPol. Combined with an innovative community policing program, PredPol has helped the department to focus on specific missions that can build a safer community. In addition to mass crime reductions, our partner agencies also report stories of crime prevention that happen on an individual level in prediction areas. For instance, in Kent, England, officers visited an area that was not considered a \"hot spot\" for crime, but PredPol\\'s patented algorithm led them there. Upon patrolling the prediction zone, officers discovered an abused woman and child. \"The officers managed to take care of them and also managed to apprehend the offender, who was a known and wanted suspect,\" says Mark Johnson, head of analysis at Kent police. Back in the United States, patrol officers in Atlanta, Georgia reported suspects in another PredPol box where robbery was likely to occur. The officer found a female whose purse had been stolen moments earlier at gunpoint, and the officer was able to detain and identify the suspects with the victim\\'s help. PredPol\\'s predictions helped lead the officer to the appropriate area, and apprehend the perpetrators. PredPol works best as a tool that assists veteran officers and analysts with their community policing efforts. Likewise, PredPol has continued to support community growth by working with local Bay Area outreach programs like Digital Nest and CSU Monterey Bay. Increasing community safety is about more than just reporting crime reductions, it is achieved through a combination of individuals cooperating with public safety organizations. PredPol is aware of this, and continues its mission to help build safer communities one story, one department at a time.',\n",

Here is a short clip with a link to the entire article:   Crime Spots: By Robert Silk [The Ascender Magazine] On Aug. 9 of this year, when the police department in Norcross, Ga. went live with a cutting edge software system designed to predict crime, it didn\\'t take long to hit pay dirt. Within a few hours of the rollout, officers were examining the scene in one of the tiny 500 square-foot areas that the software designated for beefed-up patrol when they came across a burglary-in-progress. They foiled the crime and arrested the suspect. Elsewhere in the 15,000-person northern Atlanta-area suburb that day, a deputy was patrolling around an extended-stay hotel in another area the software system had marked for extra scrutiny. She saw a man whom she thought looked suspicious. A background check revealed that her intuition was right. The man was on the run from Illinois, where arrest warrants had been issued for him on burglary-related charges. The two arrests left Norcross Lt. Bill Grogan downright giddy with the department\\'s new tool, the predictive software designed by a California company called PredPol. \"I was baffled,\" Grogran told CBS Atlanta a couple weeks later. \"I could not have ever anticipated that we would have had such a quick success. And not only that one success, but two in the same day.\" See the entire article at this link: http://www.theascender.org/issue-2/crimespots/',\n",
       " 'Government Technology Magazine Features PredPol Deployment in Tacoma: The most recent issue of Government Technology Magazine highlighted the success of PredPol\\'s predictive policing software in deployments in Tacoma, Washington and Santa Cruz, CA. The article, Predicting the Epicenter of Crime: Analytics Tool Cuts Crime Rates, explained how PredPol works and how it is being deployed in the field. Here is the article written by John Twachtman: With the right kind of data analytics, geologists can predict earthquakes. Turns out those same principles can be applied to predicting crime. That concept has been turned into an analytics tool that is now being used by more than 20 police departments in the U.S. and one in the United Kingdom.  Chief of R&D and co-founder of predictive policing company PredPol Jeffrey Brantingham explained the comparison to Government Technology. \"Look at earthquakes. You have a complex terrain that has faults all over the place. ... Big ones, small ones, and they tend to generate earthquakes at a known rate. ... And when you have those earthquakes on those faults, they produce lots of aftershocks.\" Brantingham said that crime follows a similar pattern. \"The mathematical architecture being used to study crime is closely related to what you can use to study earthquakes.\" Brantingham said that there are features in the environment that, by their nature, are prone to crime, much like faults are to earthquakes. \"A shopping mall is a great example. It\\'s a standing crop of cars to be stolen or to be broken into. It\\'s not going anywhere. It\\'s like a big fault that produces earthquakes at a regular clip.\" Crimes also tend to produce \"aftershocks,\" as criminals tend to be creatures of habit and return to the same locations where they found previous success. \"So you get these after-crimes that occur near in space and near in time to previous crimes.\" PredPol takes that information - what crime is being committed, when and where it happens - and applies mathematical algorithms, and uses it as the basis to forecast where crime will happen in the future. The concept grew out of using hot spots to track where crime is occurring (where you map crime over long intervals to see where it is concentrated to aid in the allocation of resources). But PredPol cuts down the reaction time to changes in crime patterns that might not be readily apparent by simply looking at hot spots marked on a map, thus allowing for a more real-time reaction to changes in the crime landscape. But while the tool is about predicting crime, Brantingham also pointed out that this is not a profiling tool to identify who is committing crimes. \"We\\'re actually not saying anything about who, we are saying something about where and when crime is most likely to occur regardless of who may or may not be prone to commit those crimes,\" he said. For the Santa Cruz, Calif., Police Department, statistics show an overall decline in crime in targeted areas. From 2011, when PredPol was implemented to 2012, burglaries declined 22 percent, robberies declined 27 percent, assaults were down 9 percent and arrests were up 56 percent while auto theft recovery improved by 22 percent. Available year-to-date totals through August 2013 show robberies down 4 percent and assaults down 11 percent, and though burglaries are up 7 percent for the year so far, they have seen a decrease in recent months. Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark noted that crime patterns are dynamic, but having PredPol allows for more real-time reaction to those changing patterns. He also suggested that the big drop from 2011 to 2012 accounted for the \"low-hanging fruit\" and expects the reductions to be less dramatic in years to come. Clark noted that his department was an early partner of PredPol, helping validate the predictive modeling algorithms. He approached the company after reading an article about their research, hopeful it could help in Santa Cruz, particularly as the department was facing more calls for service and a decrease in \"unobligated minutes\" when officers can patrol while not on a call. Faced with static resources, Clark said the department recognized that it needed to be more effective with its unobligated minutes to help keep communities safe and maintain quality-of-life standards. The Tacoma, Wash., Police Department also is seeing a positive impact following the start of a year-long beta test that began March 1, 2013, though no statistics are yet available. Speaking on the decision to use the tool, Assistant Chief Pete Cribbin noted that in 2005, the Tacoma Police Department began strategic planning activities, one of which was to find ways to leverage data for more effective policing. \"The police department was collecting enormous amounts of data but not effectively using [it] in crime prevention efforts,\" Cribbin said. \"The goal was to become a data-driven organization with real-time data available to all officers, investigators and command staff.\" He noted that hot spot mapping and other tools were previously employed and PredPol has become an extension of those earlier efforts. Tacoma Police Department Crime Analyst Megan Yerxa added that officers \"have the ability to look at PredPol on their smartphones and laptops in real time and make adjustments as needed. It provides a much more focused way of policing that shifts the efforts beyond responding to crime to proactively preventing it by policing the probabilities for crime.\" The department is currently using PredPol to target property crime, including residential burglary, commercial burglary, motor vehicle theft, vehicle prowls and robbery. Cribbin anecdotally noted that because of adding the PredPol analytics tool, \"we have had several successes of catching the offender \\'red-handed\\' and making arrests.\" Santa Cruz\\'s Clark also pointed to some residual benefits in changing officer habits. \"Every officer out there knows a spot on their beat where they can go right now and arrest somebody,\" Clark said. However, \"it\\'s not really addressing some of the core issues that are relating to these other crimes that we are targeting in this. ... It gives you a more purpose-based strategy as you go out there as an officer each day.\" And Clark was emphatic in stating that PredPol is a tool to enhance the work that officers do. \"This is not a substitute for your experience, your knowledge, your good old-fashioned gut sense of things,\" he said. \"This is here to help enhance that.\"',\n",
       " 'Predictive Policing Showing Early Success in Kent England An article in Euro News today spoke of the success of PredPol in Kent, England. The story is below and can be found at: http://www.euronews.com/2013/02/25/forecasting-crime/ Weather forecasting is a standard fixture but how about forecasting crime? Well, a new software programme called \"PredPol\" claims to do just that and is being trialled in the UK, by police in Kent. Detective Sergeant Martin Smith explained: \"Each box represents a 500 foot square area. The algorithm is telling us it\\'s an important part of the area to police. In the last 180 days, you\\'ve had a burglary, three vehicle crimes, four violent crimes and four criminal damages. The boxes are all lettered, so from A to Z. A, B, C, D are the most high priority.\" The crime prediction boxes are the result of the same calculations used to predict earthquakes. Using records crime data and human behaviour, the system predicts areas where offences are likely to take place. Officers receive updates from the system twice a day and then decide where to patrol. Inspector Garry Woodward said: \"It\\'s the real demographics of the area, the people, the places, what kind of buildings they are, taller buildings might mean there\\'s more crime or less, it takes into account everything.\" So far it seems that \"PredPol\" is driving down crime and helping to increase police visibility by advising officers where to deploy. Detective Inspector Jonathan Sutton said: \"It will identify a location where we are able to prevent crime from happening. By preventing crime, that naturally reduces our demand and therefore allows us to be more visible, more pro-active in our policing.\" The trials in Kent are still in the early stages but when the system was tested in California, reported crime fell by 12%, and burglaries by 27% - which is good news for all concerned.',\n",

       " \"PredPol Honored to Present at NOBLE Conference: PredPol's Dr. Jeff Brantingham was honored to present on PredPol and predictive policing at the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) National Conference this week in Michigan. The 38th annual conference, held this year in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has featured a number of outstanding speakers and events. To learn more about NOBLE click here. Created by police for police, PredPol's patented technology generates predictions about which areas and windows of time are at highest risk for future crimes. PredPol reports on property crimes, traffic accidents, drug incidents, gang activity, and gun violence. Predictions mapped to 500-by-500 foot areas using three pieces of data -- type of crime, place of crime, and time of crime -- thus avoiding profiling and privacy concerns. Patrol officers spend a few minutes in these boxes to deter and prevent crime when they're not responding to calls for service or performing other duties. The goal is better allocation of finite resources and, ultimately, crime prevention that saves a police department and city tremendous amounts of money -- more than 10 times the price of the software technology. Most importantly, predictive policing works, with a proven track record in cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Orange County, Florida, plus many agencies in Northern California. In contrast to hotspot analysis that simply maps past crime data, PredPol's first-of-its-kind technology applies advanced mathematics and computer learning that forecasts twice as many crimes as those made by current best practices.\",\n",
       " 'Machine Learning and Policing: You\\'ve probably heard the saying, \"Those who don\\'t learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.\" No one likes making mistakes and certainly not at the cost of the public\\'s safety. The law enforcement industry takes learning from its past quite seriously in order to better serve their communities. Today, police are looking to technological advances to aid in their efforts. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Take Netflix for example, it knows which movies to recommend based on the movies you\\'ve watched in the past, or the self-driving car, it knows where to go and what to do because of the data it\\'s collected based on your past behaviors. Police are using machine learning software, known as predictive policing. It provides each law enforcement agency with customized crime predictions for the places and times that crimes are most likely to occur. Today, there is a variety of different software programs that are being integrated and used throughout law enforcement agencies.  Some use data to detect a set of habits the offender follows and specifically who may be committing these crimes. While some departments find value in this type of analysis, there are serious privacy concerns to take into account. Many fear it will increase profiling,  infringing on civil liberties. Law enforcement agencies are choosing PredPol because of the unbiased nature of its algorithm. It helps police allocate their time more effectively while on patrol. It shows them where to go, how much manpower they\\'ll need and how to help residents in the communities they serve, better protect themselves from future crime. How Is PredPol Different? With PredPol, police are using historical data, then analyzing the information to prevent crimes. The data collected and analyzed is primarily victim data. Specifically, PredPol only uses time of day, location of crime and type of crime from reports in order to formulate predictions.   The program also excludes drug related offenses and traffic citation data from its predictions to remove officer bias from the equation and eliminate the risk of generating predictions based on officer discretion.  For example, if PredPol were to take citation data the boxes would only appear where patrol officers know there tends to be a lack of consideration for the speed limit. In Tacoma, officers used the information to decrease the number of home burglaries by preemptively identifying the common causes and who the repeat offenders were. \"It\\'s working smarter,\" Assistant Chief Pete Cribbin told The News Tribune. \"It\\'s chipping the high-rate offenders out of the system so you bend that number (of burglaries) down.\" In Orange County, Florida, a local news station reported, officers using PredPol from a laptop in their patrol car, see hotspots in the areas they\\'re patrolling to help them decide where to spend most of their time. Community & Trust Although predictive policing can successfully help police agencies reduce crime, community involvement is still of the utmost importance. Community involvement is another way for police to be as transparent as possible. \"As we move into predictive policing, nothing should be a secret,\" says Charlie Beck, Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. \"We should engage privacy advocates and community leaders from the outset to explain the program and get their ideas and input to alleviate their concerns.\" \"Police are not arresting people on the probability they will commit a crime,\" LAPD Lieutenant Sean Malinowski told NIJ. \"Police still must have probable cause.\" In conclusion, machine learning software like predictive policing is not the end all, but is just another powerful tool police can use to aid in their efforts to reduce crime.

       " 'Are We at a Tipping Point in Police-Community Relations?: George Floyd\\'s killing in Minneapolis was nothing less than a tragedy and a breakdown of the social contract between the protector and the protected. We know, as a nation, that far too many similar tragedies pervade our country\\'s history. Yet despite the increased recent attention on policing procedures since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner in New York City, and Freddie Gray in Baltimore, these unnecessary deaths continue. Despite decades of attempts at progress, racial inequality remains a significant problem for America - perhaps our greatest failure as a nation. Outcomes for people of color, especially Black Americans, are significantly worse than for white Americans in virtually every category: life expectancy, educational attainment, personal wealth, unemployment, and rates of incarceration. Many of these categories are influenced by interactions between Black Americans and our criminal justice system. Having a criminal record or being incarcerated has a significant impact on the ability to find or keep a job, go to college, build wealth, and raise a family - all key elements of what we think of as the \"American dream.\" We can do better. We must do better. The questions about policing go beyond just the treatment of Black Americans. Allegations of excessive force against people of all ethnicities exist, and those who live in poor communities are much more likely to have violent interactions with law enforcement. But look at much how the job of policing has changed. In most cities, a majority of officer time is spent dealing with issues that are more social than legal: homelessness, drug and alcohol addiction, mental health, and often a combination of all of these. Officers trained at the academy in the basics of law enforcement are asked to be drug counselors, social workers, and roadside psychiatrists. Even experienced officers find many of these social problems to be almost overwhelming. At the same time, the proliferation of high-powered weapons has made the job of being a peace officer much more dangerous. Civilians in the US now own 46% of the world\\'s firearms, and a study in 2018 noted that: \"American civilians own nearly 100 times as many firearms as the U.S. military and nearly 400 times as many as law enforcement.\" This has obvious implications for peace officers. Just this week, in our small rural county of Santa Cruz, California, Deputy Sgt. Damon Gutzwiller was tragically murdered in cold blood by an assailant armed with an assault rifle, pistol, and pipe bombs. Our current national dialogue around policing is long overdue. Demonstrations around the country - and the world - show that this is a matter of urgency. And yet there is a fear among many that it will fade again into the background. Emotions are running high on both sides. Demonstrations have escalated into riots. Some peaceful demonstrations have been met by disproportionate violence by police officers. At the same time, police unions around the country say they feel abandoned by their governments and their communities. What\\'s the way out? This is a highly charged discussion with no obvious or simple answers. The best place to start is with dialogue and with data. We need to have objective discussions of the problems of racial inequality in America. We need to recognize that there are significant problems in this country with homelessness, with addiction, and with mental health. We need to discuss the use of force by police, and we need to recognize when force is warranted and proportional to the situation. We also need to understand that we are putting our peace officers in sometimes impossible situations by asking them to solve problems that they are not trained or prepared for, problems that we as a country have not even been able to address adequately. PredPol was founded on the audacious premise that we could help make the practice of policing better in America. By \"better\" we mean providing less bias, more transparency, and more accountability. From the beginning, our approach has been based on data. By analyzing large, anonymized datasets, we found we could predict how certain crime types - and, conversely, rates of victimization - developed and moved throughout a city. By asking officers to patrol these locations, our partner agencies have been able to deter crimes before they occur. No crime means no victim, no investigation and arrest, and nobody to put through the criminal justice system. Everyone in society benefits. Emotion and passion from all sides will inevitably drive the conversation. That is not a bad thing: it means everyone is invested in the importance of the debate and its resolution. But in order to have this conversation, we need to find some common ground, a starting place where people can begin to work together to find solutions. We believe that the starting point is data: objective, agreed-upon facts that can be used to guide the discussion. Data provides transparency in decision making, it provides auditability of decisions, and it allows all sides to be part of the discussion using the same tools and logic. A well-educated population is the foundation of a robust democracy, and we at PredPol are profoundly hopeful that we as a country can work together to heal the very real inequalities still experienced by far too many of our citizens.

       " 'PredPol on Cover of Law Enforcement Technology Magazine The January, 2013 cover story in Law Enforcement Technology Magazine is a feature on PredPol and the success of the program in Santa Cruz and Los Angeles. For the entire article click here. Below we\\'ve included some excerpts of the article written by Ronnie Garrett. Recently a Santa Cruz, Calif. police officer noticed a suspicious subject lurking around parked cars. When the officer attempted to make contact, the subject ran. The officer gave chase; when he caught the subject he learned he was a wanted parolee. Because there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest, the subject was taken to jail. The arrest marks just another day in the life of a police officer out to predict and serve. While officers have long taken an oath to protect and serve, the officer in the above scenario was patrolling the area in question using new technology that enabled him to predict crime hot spots and take action before a crime took place. Though this case casts a public view on the technology\\'s ability to garner arrests, PredPol, named by Time Magazine as one of the Top 50 Inventions of 2011, is actually meant to reduce crime through increased police presence and deterrence, says Zach Friend, a crime analyst with the Santa Cruz PD.While arrests occur because officers are in zones the software identified as crime hot spots, Friend explains the software\\'s true utility is in crime deterrence. \"The officer [in the scenario] went into a residential area he normally wouldn\\'t have been in and saw the individual coming out of a car that clearly didn\\'t belong to him and he made an arrest,\" he says. \"But how many people didn\\'t suffer their cars being broken into because of that officer\\'s presence?\" \"PredPol helps reduce crime by increasing police presence.\" The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is the largest police agency to embrace predictive policing, which crunches crime data in real-time to determine where to send officers. To date, the LAPD has implemented the technology in five divisions covering 130 square miles.The valley\\'s Foothill Division, the first LAPD division to implement the technology, reports results that have turned even the most skeptical of skeptics into believers. \"We saw a 12-percent reduction in targeted crimes during the six-month pilot. And we saw a 26 percent reduction in burglary alone,\" says Capt. Sean Malinowski, who has worked with University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) on the project since it was nothing but a gleam in a mathematician\\'s eye. PredPol is the culmination of a seven-year study by a team of UCLA social sciences and mathematics researchers seeking to study factors that drive crime pattern formation. Anthropology professor Jeff Brantingham says researchers aimed to look into the factors that contribute to crime hot spots.He explains, \"Crime hot spots are very dynamic. In some areas, hot spots remain constant. But a lot of times [they] come and go, or spread, or go on for awhile and then disappear.\"\"But humans are not nearly as random as we think,\" Brantingham continues. \"Crime is a physical process, and if you can explain how offenders move and how they mix with victims, you can understand an incredible amount.\"',\n",
       " 'PredPol Slashes Crime in North Kent From Kent Online - by James Snaith A tough Los Angeles style of policing - which predicts crime before it happens - has seen street violence in north Kent slashed by 6%. Sounding more like a Hollywood blockbuster than crime-fighting in the county, the idea originated in the Californian city. It has now been adopted by police here as a way of cutting anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and street violence. PredPol uses software which reads the latest science, maths and human behaviour data to show the county\\'s top hotspot areas affected by crime. Officers are then sent to patrol targeted high-risk zones - sometimes as small as half the size of a football pitch - with the aim of tackling crime before it happens. Mark Johnson, Kent Police\\'s head of analysis said: \"Every day the system is fed new crime data, which is updated to produce new zones officers will target each day. \"It won\\'t change the way policing is done but it will predict crime in high-risk areas across the county in a targeted way so it helps us police more effectively. \"We\\'ve had an intelligence-led approach to crime in Kent for the last 25 years; this new system does not replace that, but will enhance it.\" A recent three-month pilot in North Kent saw levels of street violence fall by 6% when predictive policing was introduced. Kent Police\\'s Chief Constable Ian Learmonth said he was pleased with the results so far and is confident it will work across the county. He said: \"Instead of just doing a random patrol where we might come across or prevent a crime, the data tells us to go to a zone which is known to have recent levels of high risk crime and police there.\" It means more of a police presence in areas of Kent that have seen some of the highest levels of criminality. The Chief Constable added: \"The officers have enjoyed doing it because it takes them back to the policing style some joined to do. \"Officers are out, visible, doing foot patrols, engaging with the community, talking with the residents and they are dealing with the crimes they see as an added bonus. \"The public want to see visible policing on the streets; this allows us to do that.\"  ',\n",
       " 'SacBee Online - PredPol Results in \"Dramatic Crime Reduction\" Cities that have implemented PredPol, a computer software program that predicts when and where crime will occur, have seen \"cliff-like\" drops in crime often within months of deployment. PredPol is a secure, cloud-based software-as-a-service, developed by a team of PhD mathematicians, criminologists, and social scientists at UCLA, Santa Clara University, and UC Irvine in close collaboration with crime analysts and line level officers at the Los Angeles and Santa Cruz Police Departments. In just six months after launch, those first two cities saw crime reductions of 12% to 25% in burglaries and auto thefts compared to the previous Since that time, targeted crimes have continued to drop in Los Angeles, Santa Cruz and in numerous other agencies that have deployed the technology. \"I\\'m convinced that predictive policing works,\" LAPD Captain Sean Malinowski told NBC Southern California. A study of crime data going back 80 months shows a \"cliff-like drop\" when predictive policing began, according to Captain Malinowski. After these successful initial deployments PredPol has deployed its groundbreaking technology in dozens of cities around the United States as well as the United Kingdom. In Alhambra, California, police are using PredPol to target three primary crime types: car theft, theft from vehicles and auto burglary. Since deployment, those crimes have gone down by 7 percent, 20 percent and 32 percent respectively. \"PredPol is an invaluable added tool that allows our police force to use their patrol time more efficiently and helps stop crime before it happens,\" Alhambra Chief Mark Yokoyama told the Global Times. \"This technology offers an excellent crime-fighting solution that will ultimately make Alhambra safer.\" PredPol\\'s core technology has grown from success with property crimes to include prediction of drug crime, gang crime, anti-social behavior, and the recently released gun violence prediction tool. Kent Police in England have watched as violent crime has dropped by 6 percent since they began using PredPol\\'s tool and now the Seattle Police Department have partnered with PredPol to predict and deter gun violence. Dr. George Mohler, PredPol co-founder and professor of mathematics and computer science atSanta Clara University noted that, \"while no single strategy can end gun violence, predictive policing gives officers a significantly better idea of when and where to be so that they can deter crime. If we can prevent just one gun crime, that will mean one less neighbor, friend, or family member who becomes a victim.\" PredPol\\'s unique crime prediction methodology leverages existing crime data that every city already has, advanced mathematics developed over more than six years, computer learning, cloud computing, and the indispensable experience of veteran police.  The crime data is analyzed through a sophisticated algorithm that applies proven criminal theories about crime - including gun violence.  The results are more accurate and more actionable recommendations for when and where crime is most likely to occur, thus allowing police to show up before crime happens. PredPol has extensively modeled this new approach to deterring gun violence, predicting a greater number of gun homicides compared with existing approaches, including traditional hotspot maps. PredPol successfully outperforms current best practices by 66 percent. This corresponds with even stronger performance that police agencies have seen with PredPol\\'s broader technology for predicting and preventing other violent crimes and property offenses.  In scientifically controlled experiments in Los Angeles and Kent, England, PredPol\\'s predictions not only reduced crime but were 100 percent more accurate than existing best practices - predicting double the number of crimes as current crime mapping and hotspot analysis. Without predictive analytics, police are forced to chase yesterday\\'s crime by relying on simple mapping of past crime data. It would be like forecasting the weather using only historical weather patterns, but ignoring weather radar.  Traditional crime mapping tools are calibrated less frequently, rely more on humans to recognize patterns, and allocate resources based on past crimes rather than predicted future offenses. PredPol does not replace the insights of veteran officers and crime analysts, but delivers an easy-to-use enhancement that lets police do more with their current resources.  ',\n",
       " 'Richmond Police Use PredPol to Prevent Crime Below is an article from the Richmond Confidential - shared by SFGate Blog: Each morning, Richmond Police Lt. Andre Hill turns on his computer and looks at where crime is most likely to occur in the city.  \"If you look here, there\\'s five red boxes in the iron triangle for the day shift,\" Hill said, while pointing at his computer screen. Each box represents a two and a half square block area where burglaries, car thefts, and robberies are most likely to take place. RPD officers in patrol spend at least 40 minutes per shift in each of the boxes. \"They park their car, get out, walk around, and engage with the community,\" Hill said. Theoretically, their presence will suppress crime before it happens. The computer system is called predictive policing. It\\'s an algorithm--similar to one used to predict aftershocks from an earthquake--that analyzes data and forecasts the likelihood of crimes occurring in certain areas. \"With this system, we can say that between 6 o\\'clock and 10 o\\'clock at night, this is where crime is most likely to occur,\" RPD Captain Mark Gagan said. \"With that information we can be much more focused.\" RPD began using the system in June. While it\\'s too soon to definitively say whether or not it has been effective, the system has been widely praised both within the department, and by other California police agencies. The Santa Cruz police department implemented the system in 2011, and since then overall crime has declined significantly--the only way to measure the system\\'s efficacy since it\\'s meant to prevent crime from occurring. However, according to police records, calls for service and arrests have increased, the latter by 56 percent. \"From a statistician\\'s point of view you wouldn\\'t expect that,\" Santa Cruz Deputy Chief Steven Clark said. With more calls for service and more arrests, logically one would expect more crime. However, the data suggests that police are increasingly in the right place at the right time. \"It seems like the program\\'s working, especially when you look at the surrounding communities that are dealing with increases in crime,\" Clark said. The LAPD began using predictive policing in 2012, and results have been positive. In Richmond, vehicle theft is down 23 percent and burglaries are down 10 percent since this time last year, according to police records. The department hopes the system will help ease a recent spike in robberies, which have increased by 24 percent since last year. However, Captain Gagan said the system isn\\'t a panacea. \"Nothing is ever going to replace an officer\\'s ability to listen to people, talk to people, and connect to people,\" he said. The department is debating whether predictive policing maps would be more useful if they were publicly available, allowing residents to see where they\\'re most likely to become a victim of crime.  \"Having community looking out for each other and knowing what\\'s going on in the neighborhood is much more powerful than having police officers at the right place at the right time,\" Gagan said. However, because the technology is still new to the department, it has yet to decide what to do about making maps available to the public.  ',\n",

According to the TV station KIRO, the mayor said \"The software has been used by police departments all over the nation to reduce crime through deep analysis of crime and location data. The software makes predictions about the places where crime is likely to occur, based on crime and location data from police reports.  It does not predict who, only where.  But by knowing the place where crimes are likely to occur, it enables SPD to deploy patrols where they are most needed, and it allows the community to develop strategies to make places safer.\" \"We\\'ve heard from communities, particularly in the North Precinct, through our Safe Communities outreach process that we need better data analysis to prevent property crime,\" said  Mayor McGinn. \"We\\'ve had anecdotal successes with the pilot project in East and Southwest Precincts, so we\\'re expanding Predictive Policing citywide. We\\'re asking the community to get involved by reporting even minor property crimes so we can improve our data set and predict where crime is likely to occur. This is a tool that can help us prevent some crimes before they happen, so it\\'s very important that community members get involved.\" \"Predictive Policing is a technology tool that increases our odds of stopping crime because it tells law enforcement when and where crime is likely to occur\" said Deputy Chief Metz. \"With the community\\'s help, we can prevent some crimes before they take place by being in the right place at the right time.\" PredPol is proud to be partnering with Seattle to help reduce crime!',\n",

       " 'Predictive Policing and Crime Displacement This post addresses the myth of crime displacement, which simply describes the expectation that crime moves from one area to another due to police prevention efforts. Some might think that if law enforcement\\'s crime prevention efforts are helping to deter crime in one area, that criminals will commit those crimes elsewhere. The research shows otherwise. When data-driven patrol takes away crime opportunities, most offenders opt to not commit the crime. Studies on criminology show that criminals often offend in the places where they are most comfortable. If there is repeated police deterrence, it reduces their willingness to offend in that location. They weigh the options and much of the time, will not relocate or think of the opportunities in another location as good. Several other criminology studies disprove displacement theory - many dating as far back as 1993. A recent, National Institute of Justice study stated that, \"quantitative measures offer strong support for prior studies that show that focused crime prevention efforts are not likely to have large displacement effects to areas nearby. In this sense, crime does not seem to simply \"move around the corner\" as a result of hot spot policing efforts.\" Using data about where and when crimes have been committed in the past, PredPol provides patrol officers predictions that give them the best chance of denying opportunities for future crimes to occur, shift by shift. PredPol\\'s most recent study was conducted by the Atlanta Police Foundation after a predictive policing trial in 2013. Atlanta was broken up into six different policing \\'Zones\\' and different Part 1 crime types were used to measure PredPol\\'s predictive accuracy, crime reduction results, and effects on crime displacement. These charts show the average percentage of burglary & robbery crime within x distance from a PredPol box. The first rows display the 4 zones that were not deploying PredPol during the trial. The second rows display the 2 zones where PredPol was deployed:  According to crime displacement theory, crime within x distance from a PredPol box in the 2 zones where PredPol is deployed should be higher than in the non-deployed zones, because PredPol is shifting crime \"around the corner\".',\n",
       " 'Preventing Crime vs. Preventing Criminality: How do you show that prevented crime isn\\'t just being pushed into other neighborhoods? That is what\\'s called \"displacement,\" and it\\'s been a hot topic in criminality for decades. All of the experiments that have been done on displacement have pointed to a conclusion that is incomplete. For some offenders, if you take away their preferred location, they will desist for a time. In the time that they are desisting, you will get fewer crimes. There is a key distinction here: the difference between preventing crime and preventing criminality. If you take someone that has a serious drug dependency and they are committing property crimes for the purpose of supporting their drug habit, preventing them from committing a crime today is a benefit to the community because you have one less crime today. However, in doing so you haven\\'t solved the problem of that person\\'s drug dependency. That is a completely separate issue.  What we\\'ve been working on is about preventing crime, rather than criminality. Preventing criminality is potentially a much harder problem. Criminality is multi-causal--there are lots of reasons why someone is willing to commit crimes in the first place. One of the big challenges is that criminality is something that occurs over a lifetime. So with a lot of policy ideas, if they get put into place, you\\'re not going to know how they work for 8, 10, or 15 years. That\\'s a huge challenge. We\\'re not about preventing criminality; we\\'re about disrupting opportunities for crime in the here and now.   ',\n",

       " \"Predictive Analytics: Beyond Policing: The concept of predictive policing has been embraced by a growing number of law enforcement agencies as an effective tool to reduce crime rates and victimization. Predictive policing is the practice of applying analytical techniques to large crime datasets to enable law enforcement to identify where and when specific crimes are most likely to occur. This allows officers to take a more proactive approach to combating crimes, rather than responding to the scene after a crime is reported. A variety of software platforms, including PredPol, have been developed to help police identify locations, crime types, and the time of day when these crimes are most likely to occur. PredPol uses only three data points to make its predictions: crime type, crime location and the date and time of the crime. PredPol does not use any personal or demographic data, such as information about the offender or the neighborhood because this information actually makes predictions less effective. An additional benefit of this approach is that it eliminates any chance of inadvertent bias or profiling. Although local law enforcement agencies have been the pioneers in applying predictive policing technologies, they're not the only organizations that can benefit. Applying Predictive Analytics to Retail The National Association for Shoplifting Prevention reports there are about 27 million shoplifters nationally--that's 2 in 11 people! The costs can add up, especially for big store retailers that can see anywhere from millions to billions of dollars in loss prevention expenses and costs annually. Applying PredPol's existing algorithms and using the three data points mentioned above, a platform such as PredPol could analyze data for shoplifting events by store location and time of day. Identifying shoplifting patterns would allow loss-prevention officers to proactively patrol these locations or take other measures to reduce theft. The National Retail Federation  shared a success story of a Co-Op in the United Kingdom that significantly reduced crime, theft and operating costs with the help of data analytics. Protecting the Masses Large corporate campuses often use private security services or their own staff to respond to non-critical security events before law enforcement gets involved. With sufficient event data, their staff can also proactively patrol targeted areas to reduce rates of minor crimes such as auto burglaries materials thefts. Large private/public event spaces such as malls and stadiums can also use predictive analytics to identify event hotspots and deploy security personnel to reduce the rate of crimes common to such spaces, such as pickpocketing and robberies. Could the use of PredPol in the private sector be in the near future? There's certainly a need for it. \",\n",

       " 'Santa Cruz PD\\'s PredPol adds tool for cops, neighbors From the Santa Cruz Sentinel - Aug. 14: By Stephen Baxter: On a day meant to introduce residents to predictive policing hot spots that officers check in their down time, Santa Cruz police Wednesday arrested a man on Beach Street during a predictive check. The day was billed as International Predictive Policing Day of Action, with police in Kent, England, and Los Angeles sharing locations with residents to try to increase their presence on the street and hopefully prevent crime. Near Beach and Main streets about 11:45 a.m., police apprehended a 47-year-old man on suspicion of being drunk in public and carrying a concealed knife, both misdemeanors. Police said it was a small illustration of the idea at work. \"Our goal today is not to arrest a lot of people, it\\'s to prevent the crime from happening,\" said Santa Cruz Police Chief Kevin Vogel. \"I\\'m exceptionally proud that we were the first ones to do this.\" Launched in 2011, the program essentially uses historical data of the time and location of burglaries and thefts and uses an algorithm to predict future crime. When officers are not responding to other calls, they are asked to patrol in those areas. Wednesday, some residents gathered at places such as lower Ocean Street and Lincoln and Chestnut streets, which were predicted to have a higher likelihood of burglary, vehicle burglary or vehicle theft. \"It\\'s almost like Neighborhood Watch in the next century,\" said Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark. Clark said police have not tracked the number of arrests that have come from the \"extra checks,\" as police often call them. Yet he said that once or twice a week, an officer on a predictive policing check has either talked to a suspicious person, received information on another case or made an arrest. The arrests have not been associated with major crimes such as murders or robberies, but they have helped to solve burglaries and put police in places they might not think to patrol. It\\'s been a tool that officers have added to their natural intuition, Clark said. PREDICTIVE EXAMPLES One night in 2012, for instance, officers were on an extra check near Windham Street when they talked to a man who had more than four GPS units on him. \"No one\\'s that lost,\" Clark said. Through more investigation, \"We wrapped up several auto burglary cases off that.\" Last year near North Branciforte and Goss avenues, police stopped a bicyclist and recognized him as a drug user. He wore a NCAA basketball ring and didn\\'t look like a basketball player; police later linked it to a burglary and returned it. Clark\\'s favorite example is that of a Santa Cruz beat cop who was eating his lunch in his patrol car in a downtown parking lot because it was on that shift\\'s predictive list. He spotted two women trying to break into cars and arrested them. For neighborhood leaders like Deborah Elston, the list of 15 predictive policing addresses distributed to neighbors on Wednesday were not a big surprise. They included five areas in the Lower Ocean Street neighborhood, as well as the 100 block of Beach Street and near Seabright Avenue and Murray Street. Elston was pleased that the list was shared with neighbors, and she encouraged residents to be aware of suspicious people and problems like graffiti -- which can lead to more crime. \"When you make the 911 call to report suspicious activity, you never know what you\\'re preventing,\" Elston said. Although many factors go in to crime trends, overall reported crime dropped more than 25 percent in June and July compared with June and July 2012, according to police. For instance, there were 45 reported burglaries in the city in July 2013, down from 67 in July 2012. Elston said she understood it might be difficult to quantify the success of predictive policing because crime could have been prevented by the presence of an officer or neighbor. The person trying door handles on cars to steal things might have gone elsewhere, for instance. Yet she said that twice in the first few months of the predictive program, she had her cellphone out to call 911 for a suspicious person when an officer on an extra check arrived. One time was on the San Lorenzo River levee when an officer rolled up to her. She told him, \"I was just about to call you.\"  ',\n",

       " \"Managing Culture Change in Law Enforcement: With the advent of new technology, law enforcement seems to be at a bit of a crossroads. Some traditional practices of policing are being disrupted. New tools and new tech are forcing most departments to change the way they police, with chiefs and command staff leading the charge. Changing the culture within your department can be the key to improved officer effectiveness and community satisfaction. So, how does one go about making such a change? We asked our law enforcement partner Deputy Chief Armendariz from Modesto (California) PD how he transformed his department from presiding over one of the highest crime rates in the country to become one of the most effective agencies, and how PredPol played an integral part in creating that change.  3 Ways PredPol Can Help Drive Culture Change: 1- Same page. Chief Armendariz says that using PredPol at his department is a sure-fire way to make sure everyone is on the same page. Whether he's got a new hire who has only been on the job a few weeks or an officer who has been at the department for 10 years, they both have access to the same mission and patrol information through PredPol's application. This ensures that each officer on each shift understands what the objective is and where they can access the information necessary to be as prepared as possible before going out on patrol.  2- You can't manage what you're not measuring. As a new chief you're expected to produce results fast. Chief Armendariz found that PredPol's GPS feature and analytics dashboard made this more manageable. He was able to clearly see if his officers were doing what they needed to do in order to drive down crime, and he was able to easily share his results with the city and the community. It's important for a chief and other command staff to have insight into what their officers are doing while out on patrol in order to make necessary adjustments. Transparency is extremely important when it comes to creating a culture change in a department and achieving positive results. 3- Don't just be efficient, be effective. Efficiency is about getting the most out of your resources; effectiveness is all about getting those resources to achieve your goals. Officers must be effective in order to see crime reduction results like Chief Armendariz has seen in Modesto. PredPol has helped him change the culture of his department to be a proactive one rather than reactive. In order to be successful at reducing crime you have to get out in front of it. Chief Armendariz tells his officers that being effective is more about what you do when you get in the box. Officers have even stopped crime in PredPol boxes as it was happening! Modesto PD has also found other creative ways of deterring crime, including parking a police-issued vehicle in a PredPol box as well as deploying community service leaders to PredPol boxes. Below are some of Modesto PD's crime stats for the past 5 years using PredPol. You can see that Chief Armendariz's proactive approach to policing has produced AMAZING crime reduction results over the years! Make departmental culture change more manageable and get the results you're looking for with PredPol. \",\n",
       " \"Why PredPol Is Not Like Minority Report Too often when people hear the phrase predictive policing, they think of the film Minority Report. In the film, crimes are predicted by a group of clairvoyants, and individuals are arrested on the basis that they will commit the crime. But PredPol is nothing like Minority Report. First, PredPol predicts where and when a crime is most likely to occur, not who is likely to commit a crime. Because no personal data, information about individuals or demographics are utilized in making these predictions, PredPol's technology does not pose any personal privacy or profiling concerns. Next, predictions are made using a unique algorithm based on three simple data points: Place, time and date of past crimes. This data exists to efficiently guide law enforcement patrols and lower crime through intelligent, community policing methods. PredPol's most successful deployment results occur when agencies advise patrol to maintain visibility in predicted areas as they respond to daily calls. Finally, the patterns inherent in the crimes themselves provide ample information to predict which places and windows of time are at highest risk for future crimes. This is the basic theory of predictive policing: a lot of crime is not random. For example, home burglaries are relatively predictable. When a house gets robbed, the likelihood of that house or houses near it getting robbed again spikes in the following days. Using this prediction methodology, crimes are separated from individuals, and a visible law enforcement presence can be an effective deterrent of subsequent crimes.

       " 'So You Think You Can Build Your Own Predictive Policing Platform?: The use of proactive police patrols to deter crime in targeted areas is a core concept of police operations. The reasoning behind this is that the presence of a police officer increases the risk for a potential offender and therefore has a deterrent effect. Predictive policing is simply the use of data analytics to make patrol recommendations that are more accurate than traditional techniques - and therefore more effective at reducing crime. There are lots of ways to use data to guide patrol operations, ranging from putting pins on a paper map on the wall to creating heatmaps of historical data. With the advent of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques, there are seemingly an unlimited number of ways an agency could apply technology to create a predictive policing model. Are you REALLY up for the challenge? There are several technical challenges in developing a model to predict the times and locations most at risk for future crimes. So we narrowed it down to four of the most the most significant ones: 1- Determining which data to use. In other words, what data best predicts the likelihood of future crimes? Some theories and models have proposed using weather, unemployment rates, housing prices, educational attainment, income disparity, the prevalence of illicit drug use, days of the week, the placement of \"crime attractors\" such as bus stations or shopping center parking lots, and so on. Finding the data you want to use is the first half of the data problem; the other half is getting continuous access to a timely, accurate and granular (location-specific) source for that data. Weather forecasts, for example, are generated on a daily basis but not always accurate or granular enough. Unemployment data may be accurate, but only generated once a year and not at a useful level of granularity. Housing prices, while granular, are generated only periodically and therefore not very timely. 2- Find a model that can make accurate predictions. These first two challenges are to some degree intertwined. There are a range of predictive models available now, some with exotic names like naive Bayes classifiers, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The model you select is dependent on the kind of data you feed into it, so selecting your preferred predictive model goes hand in hand with selecting the kind of data you want to use. A robust model should be able to predict for a variety of crimes ranging from property crimes to violent crimes, and it should have a consistent level of accuracy for the types of crimes predicted. It should work as well on weekdays as weekends, days as well as nights, and should work as well in winter as in summer. 3- Time to turn this into a mission-critical platform. Ok, so you think you\\'ve found a data source that is accurate, timely and granular enough. You\\'ve matched it with an algorithm that seems to work with that data and produce accurate forecasts of crime by crime type, time and location. Now, you need resilient methods of getting data into your system, with error flagging and fallback scenarios for when your data sources go down. You need audit capabilities to ensure the data quality remains consistent. It needs to run in an environment where it is available on a 7x24 basis, and scale up when lots of users are accessing the system. And don\\'t forget the security aspects! You will want to ensure that data is encrypted in transit and at rest. You will need to set role-based access and transaction levels for the different people in your organization, and keep audit logs of all transactions on your system down to the user level. Depending on the kind of data you store, you may also be subject to CJIS (criminal justice information system) compliance standards if you operate in the US. 4- Still think you can manage all of this? Well we\\'ve yet to go over your final - and perhaps most difficult - challenge! You need to find a way to deliver your predictions as patrol recommendations to the ultimate end user: the patrol officer. To do this effectively, you need to make a number of policy and design decisions. Are you providing heat maps, numeric scores, rankings? Do you cover the entire city, or just highlight specific high-risk areas? Do you make predictions at the city/county level or make recommendations for each officer\\'s patrol area? Which crimes - or combination of crimes - are you predicting, and will that vary by day of week, time of day, and/or patrol area? Whatever you decide, you will need to find a way to deliver your recommendations to patrol officers in a clear, unambiguous, actionable manner. Access to the relevant information should be secure yet simple, without the need to master a new technology. The more friction you introduce, the less chance you have of officer adoption. And without officer adoption, your sophisticated new predictive policing platform will go unused. Too much? Don\\'t worry, we\\'ve got you. PredPol uses only 3 data points in our model: crime type, crime location, and crime date/time. We do not use or store any personally identifiable information regarding the victim or suspected perpetrator of these crimes. We never use arrest data, nor do we predict for crime types that could be initiated at the discretion of the patrol officer (for example, drug sales or prostitution). By focusing only on data as reported by victims to law enforcement, we direct officers to the locations where the risk of future victimization is highest. We have published (and patented) our algorithm and research in peer-reviewed studies, and it has been proven to be the most accurate on the market. The PredPol platform represents approximately 10 years of research and development and the equivalent of 70 research-years of PhD-level mathematicians, computer scientists and criminologists. Our platform has been tested and proven in dozens of departments in multiple countries over the last 6+ years and it now represents the feedback from over 100 million officer-hours of usage in the field. While we are heartened to see that other agencies believe in the concept of predictive policing so much that they are considering developing their own models, but why not leave it to the professionals? PredPol continues to provide the most unbiased, accurate and cost-effective approach available in the predictive policing market. Want to learn more about how PredPol works?

       " 'Santa Clara Newspaper Features PredPol: From The Santa Clara newspaper... Putting a cop at the crime scene before it happens with a mathematical formula sounds like it came straight out of a Hollywood movie, but with new technology, it\\'s now possible. George Mohler, an assistant professor in the mathematics and computer science department at Santa Clara University, is one of the masterminds behind Predictive Policing, a new computer software. His company, PredPol, may be the next era of crime prevention. Since police departments nationwide are facing budget cuts, this new resource allows them to be more effective and responds to public demand for crime prevention without spending more money. Mohler started working with a team of researchers from the University of California Mathematical and Simulation Modeling of Crime project, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation. The UC MaSC project has one goal: to develop a statistical model for crime. With the help of research from this group, Mohler was able to come up with a mathematical equation to predict crime based on the same formula currently used to predict aftershocks for earthquakes. After publishing papers about his theory, Zach Friend, Santa Cruz Police crime analyst, reached out to Mohler about implementing the algorithm. The predictive policing program was put to the test. \"We decided to try the predictive policing program because our department had experienced about a 20 percent decline in staffing coupled with a 30 percent increase in call-for-services,\" said Friend. Since implementing the program, there has been a decrease in Santa Cruz crime, including residential, commercial and vehicular burglaries, dropping all burglaries by 27 percent. Another experiment with Los Angles Police Department saw similar drops in crime. Mohler presented the statistical model to one of his classes at Santa Clara. One of his calculus students, Omar Qazi, approached Mohler after the discussion. \"I knew I could make his software better,\" said Qazi. Qazi and Mohler started working together to further develop the software. \"(Qazi) has ultimately made this software better, and I would work with him regardless of his age because he is a unique, talented individual,\" said Mohler. PredPol analyzes the times, dates and places of recent crimes. It updates constantly when new crimes occur and then finds patterns that forecast high-risk times and locations for future crime. The cost to implement PredPol depends on the population of the city, but it is always less than the cost of hiring an officer for a year. PredPol may violate the Fourth Amendment, however, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Professor Andrew Ferguson from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law wrote an article called \"Predictive Policing and Reasonable Suspicion,\" examining predictive policing and the possibilities of how it will impact reasonable suspicion. \"In the future, predictive policing will affect the Fourth Amendment reasonable suspicion analysis,\" said Ferguson. \"How it affects it and whether these changes weaken or strengthen Fourth Amendment protections remains unclear.\" Friend said, \"The program is not a replacement for an officer\\'s talents, intuition or experience. It is simply a tool that helps them do their job.\" The Sponsored Projects Office at the university assists in proposal, funding, developing project ideas and submitting completed project plans.

       " 'Predictive Policing Technology Dramatically Reducing Crime in Large & Small Communities Across U.S. & Overseas Santa Cruz, California -- Communities across the United States and overseas are experiencing dramatic reductions in crime -- thanks in large part to PredPol, predictive policing technology that is helping law enforcement prevent crime before it occurs. \"Most importantly, double digit reductions in crime ensure that fewer people become victims,\" said PredPol CEO Larry Samuels, \"and they also result in more efficient deployment of finite policing resources and tremendous cost savings to our communities.\" PredPol predicts where and when a crime is most likely to occur, not who is likely to commit a crime. Because no personal data, information about individuals or demographics are utilized in making these predictions, PredPol\\'s law enforcement technology does not pose any personal privacy or profiling concerns. For example: PredPol supports officers and analysts in predicting crimes that include property crimes, drug incidents, gang activity, gun violence, and even traffic accidents. A unique algorithm analyzes only three simple data points: place, time and date of past crimes. The patterns inherent in the crimes themselves provide ample information to predict which places and windows of time are at highest risk for future crimes. PredPol provides law enforcement agencies with affordable, customized crime predictions for localized areas - 500 feet by 500 feet boxes on maps. Once police and analysts make decisions about which crimes and missions are priorities, maps are automatically generated for each shift of a particular day. Typically, patrol officers spend a few minutes in PredPol boxes to strengthen community ties and deter crime when they\\'re not responding to calls for service or performing other duties. Some of these boxes are in places that officers routinely cover, but many PredPol prediction boxes are in places that might not otherwise receive attention.',\n",

Created by police for police, PredPol's patent-pending technology generates predictions about which areas and windows of time are at highest risk for future crimes. PredPol reports on property crimes, traffic accidents, drug incidents, gang activity, and gun violence. Predictions mapped to 500-by-500 foot areas using three pieces of data -- type of crime, place of crime, and time of crime -- thus avoiding profiling and privacy concerns. Patrol officers spend a few minutes in these boxes to deter and prevent crime when they're not responding to calls for service or performing other duties. The goal is better allocation of finite resources and, ultimately, crime prevention that saves a police department and city tremendous amounts of money -- more than 10 times the price of the software technology. Most importantly, predictive policing works, with a proven track record in cities like Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Orange County, Florida, plus many agencies in Northern California. In contrast to hotspot analysis that simply maps past crime data, PredPol's first-of-its-kind technology applies advanced mathematics and computer learning that forecasts twice as many crimes as those made by current best practices.\",\n",

       " 'Alhambra Police Laud PredPol Successes From the Pasadena Star News - February 11, 2014 By Zen Vuong ALHAMBRA >> A year after the Police Department implemented predictive policing software, car burglaries and vehicle thefts have decreased, Chief Mark Yokoyama said. In January 2013, Alhambra was the first law-enforcement agency in Southern California to have citywide implementation of PredPol, a cloud-based software that forecasts areas where crimes are likely to be committed. Nine months ago, some residents expressed reservations about technology that could target the homeless or minorities, but co-founder Jeffrey Brantingham, a UCLA anthropology professor, said PredPol doesn\\'t use personal information to predict crime. \"It doesn\\'t include who the offenders are or what type of music they like or anything like that,\" he said. \"It\\'s focusing on where the crimes are happening. The public calls the police and report crime. Police are using data they are given. They\\'re actually doing what the public wants. It\\'s nothing like \\'Minority Report\\' or criminal profiling.\" PredPol uses five years\\' worth of law-breaking data to map a 500-by-500-square-foot area where crime will likely happen. The technology essentially places officers at the right place and time to prevent lawbreaking. The Alhambra Police Department focused on the two most common crimes in Alhambra, Yokoyama said. By year\\'s end, when compared to 2012 numbers, car burglaries decreased by 21 percent, and auto theft declined by 8 percent, a statistics report showed. Yokoyama said the system works. He recalled a time when police officers were patrolling Valley Boulevard at PredPol\\'s direction and noticed a suspicious vehicle. They found ski masks inside the vehicles and arrested the individuals on suspicion of robbery, he said. \"The act of robbery, burglary, et cetera does not have to be committed for a crime to occur,\" Yokoyama said. \"The planning and actions toward committing the crime is a crime in and of itself. In fact, it would always be our preference to stop a crime at this stage than for an act to occur.\" Yokoyama added that giving officers direct, clear missions to patrol particular areas has had a positive effect that residents and business owners have noticed. \"It\\'s actually increased our communication and visibility to the community because (police officers are) spending more time in the residential area, as an example,\" Yokoyama said. \"I get (positive) calls all the time about why the police are in their neighborhood more.\" Residents such as William Rising, however, said he hasn\\'t noticed more officers on the streets. But he said response time to emergency calls has improved. \"Just a more visible police presence can avert many potential criminal activities, such as car theft, break-ins and drug dealing,\" he said in a Facebook post. In addition to printouts of potential crime areas, Yokoyama said every police car is now equipped with in-car computers that receive refreshed information every five minutes. In general, he said, officers spend about 35 percent of their time doing random patrols based on their knowledge of the city, and they spend 5 percent of their time focused in the 500-by-500-square-foot areas to which PredPol directs them. Yet the crime rate for certain activities has increased. Residential burglaries went up by 17 percent and robberies increased by 22 percent, a report found. \"Although the numbers are up, based on PredPol predictions, we feel a number of crimes were prevented and would have been higher if not for PredPol missions,\" Yokoyama said.',\n",
       " 'Open Up Your Own Data With PredPol\\'s NEW APIs: PredPol recently released our developer APIs and we\\'re very excited about it. API is a computer-speak acronym that means \"application program interface.\" In layman\\'s terms, an API is a software service that lets different applications share data with each other securely. This is a major step for PredPol as we evolve into becoming a broad law enforcement technology platform. Our APIs support both inbound and outbound data. This will make it easier to transfer data into PredPol as well as transfer data out of PredPol to other systems. The kind of data that goes into PredPol remains the same as before - we still use only the what-where-when attributes of event data: Note that we never use any personally identifiable information, nor do we use arrest data, demographic information, or any other data fields. Event types can range from crimes such as robberies and auto theft, other public safety events such as traffic collisions, and calls for service for medical events such as overdoses. With our API, we can connect directly into the information systems used by our partners. These include typical law enforcement systems such as records management systems (RMSs) and computer assisted dispatch (CAD) systems, or other databases tracking event data. Our API allows us to securely and easily import the information we need from our partners on a real-time basis with no ongoing work required. We can even ingest data in from sensors to track events like gunfire. PredPol also uses our APIs to push data out into other systems. Our philosophy is that our partners own their data, so they shouldn\\'t have to be tied to proprietary systems or pay their technology vendors extra money just to get access to it. Virtually all of the data we collect and create - raw event data, predictions, GPS locations, dosage, missions, event statistics - is easily exportable to external systems via our well-documented APIs. Of course, we also allow our users to export their data into PDFs, CSVs, shapefiles and KMLs as well. Our API documentation includes authentication and key management, data structures and field definitions, and code samples to simplify integration. Development assistance and ongoing support is also provided by the amazing PredPol engineering team. The PredPol APIs can shorten your deployment time significantly. Once they are set up, they will also virtually eliminate ongoing support and maintenance tasks - all the heavy lifting is done on our servers, in the highly secure Microsoft Azure Government Cloud.

Shades of the 2002 Tom Cruise futuristic action thriller Minority Report? Well, in a way yes. No \\'precogs\" are being tethered to a computer yet, but some police agencies south of the border are experimenting with analytics technologies and what is being called predictive policing. For example, for the last seven years the PredPol algorithm developed by a team of mathematicians and social scientists at the University of Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Santa Clara and UC Irvine, has been analyzing crime incident information to some members of the Los Angeles Police predict where certain types of property-related crimes are most likely to happen during certain police patrol shifts. Similar experiments in police precincts in New York and Boston using other technologies have also been carried out.

The technology is designed to predict where crimes are likely to occur in place-based \"prediction boxes\" as small as 500\\' x 500\\'. PredPol is a secure, cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform. Crime data, specific to crime type and specific to police shifts is mapped into it instantaneously as the information is reported to the system.

The PredPol report is shared is distributed to police during the roll call and call also be delivered to officers in the form of a paper report on transmitted to their smart phones or tablet devices. While traditional crime analysis tools such as ComStat provide a \"rear view mirror policing\" by mapping past crime to come up with \"some hints at the future,\" PredPol tells the police where crime is likely to happen in the near future. For example, the model can actually predict the risk of a crime in one location for the next 10 to 12 hours even if the latest crime reported occurred in a different location, according to users.

As Baby Boomer officers are retiring, many agencies have found it difficult to attract and keep Millennial officers. The traditional way of recruiting doesn't necessarily work for this generation. Departments are finding that they are having to adapt to the changing values and practices of this younger generation. Millennials grew up with technology at their fingertips; as a result they expect technology to play a key role in any job they do. Offering the chance to use state-of-the-art technology is an attractive incentive for this generation. PredPol is at the forefront of public safety technology. From automating patrol missions and providing daily feedback on crime and patrol stats, to using artificial intelligence to predict when and where specific crimes will happen, we are constantly updating and releasing new features to stay one step ahead of emerging law enforcement technology trends. How can PredPol be used to recruit and retain Millennial officers? Millennials will be a great asset to law enforcement agencies. However, to attract and retain Millennial officers, departments need to re-examine traditional recruitment strategies, encourage collaboration, and invest in technology.

       " 'Dr. Jeff Brantingham Featured in UCLA Article on PredPol By Sam Hoff  - UCLA Daily Bruin A UCLA anthropology professor studies an unorthodox type of hunter-gatherer - one who forages for unlocked cars and hunts for easily stolen property. Professor Jeffrey Brantingham, who specializes in criminology, uses knowledge of past crimes to determine criminal hot spots and then predict where crimes are likely to occur. \"Criminals are effectively foragers,\" Brantingham said. \"Choosing what car to steal is like choosing which animal to hunt. The same decision-making processes go into both of these choices.\" Brantingham\\'s primary work within the anthropology department at UCLA is in human behavior and evolution, especially foraging and why humans have particular behavioral adaptations. Expanding on this specialty, he helped to develop a software called Predictive Policing, or PredPol, after years of researching crime trends. The program, which Brantingham and colleagues launched in 2011, takes crime data supplied by police forces and applies mathematical formulas similar to those used to study chemical reactions or predict earthquake aftershocks to the data, Brantingham said. PredPol predicts physical areas, marked as 500-square-foot boxes on Google Maps, identifying where crimes such as car thefts and burglaries are likely to happen on a given day, said Sean Malinowski, a captain at the Los Angeles Police Department\\'s Foothill division who works closely with the software. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly using hard data to make both long- and short-term decisions, Andrea Bertozzi, director of applied mathematics, said. The Santa Cruz Police Department first implemented PredPol in July 2011. In a trial of the program in Santa Cruz, burglary rates dropped significantly from the previous year because police were able to better predict where to send patrol cars, Malinowski said. Each patrol car is assigned two of the hot spots every day or night shift in the LAPD program, which they are instructed to patrol more heavily than other areas, Malinowski said. The officers are also asked to spend 15 to 20 minutes in the box, attempting to deter criminals by using methods based on the predicted crime. For instance, if burglaries from motor vehicles are predicted, officers may walk near parked cars, Malinowski said. Brantingham\\'s interest in criminology is a few decades in the making. His parents are well-known criminologists at Simon Fraser University in Canada and he said that conversations about crime that he heard growing up impacted his career path. \"I didn\\'t realize it, but I was accumulating knowledge by osmosis, hearing about crime and criminal behavior while spending time with my parents,\" Brantingham said. Brantingham\\'s idea for PredPol came after years of research alongside UCLA faculty and graduate students about mathematical simulations of crime. Bertozzi worked alongside Brantingham as a fellow principal investigator in a different academic research project that served as a precursor to PredPol. \"We did the heavy lifting on the math side, but it was more of a partnership,\" she said. \"(Brantingham) was really the guy who took our math and applied it to actual crime.\" While the first research project was purely academic, Brantingham said that he found that a crime forecasting tool could be developed to apply his academic findings to a practical setting. In November 2011, LAPD compared the software to predictions from human crime analysts. During the analysis, Malinowski said he observed a 12 percent reduction in crime because of PredPol, including a 25 percent reduction in burglaries. Because of the successful trial run, Brantingham and his associates later officially launched PredPol, which is now implemented in seven divisions of the LAPD as well as other agencies around the world. Analysts tend to skew their data, placing more emphasis on recent crimes. However, the PredPol software takes into account seven years of data, providing more reliable results, Malinowski said. \"PredPol removes the bias and adds a lot more data,\" he said. \"It does a better job of directing officers where to be and when to be there.\" Police officers at the Foothill division were able to curb six to eight crimes per week when using the software, he said. While it could be feasible to extend the program to UCLA\\'s university police, there are special challenges when it comes to crime mapping on college campuses with large, multistory buildings, Brantingham said. \"The way databases are constructed doesn\\'t favor a campus environment,\" he said. As he balances his tenure as a professor and providing expertise at PredPol, Brantingham is expanding his research focus beyond mapping property crimes. Brantingham\\'s newest work in the areas of gang crime, social networking and crime and predicting violent crime further applies his background in anthropology to predict the actions of the urban hunter-gatherer.

New policing strategies implemented by the RPD over the last year have contributed to a 23 percent drop in burglaries, according to Chief Bill Heim. The department, Heim said, has combined predictive policing data with its existing crime-mapping system, allowing it to shift officers\\' efforts from places that have experience crime to areas where the next crime was predicted to occur. \"With almost 100,000 residents, we need to be doing everything we can to keep Reading residents safer,\" Heim said. \"We\\'ve lost over 45 officer positions due to financial constraints but have gained this invaluable tool.\" History of PredPol in Reading: The RPD began using predictive policing software, called PredPol, in October 2013 to help it identify where to strategically deploy officers in the places and at the times crime is most likely to occur. Using a unique algorithm, PredPol provides Reading crime analysts and officers with customized \"boxes\" on maps of the city, identifying the 500-by-500-foot areas where the highest probability exists for a crime to occur, explained Heim, adding that the boxes are automatically generated for each shift of each day. \"We\\'ve been tracking the number of times our officers patrol inside the PredPol boxes. Their presence really helps deter crime,\" Heim remarked. \"It\\'s shown itself to be a real force-multiplier in crime prevention.\" How PredPol is Used in Reading: The chief noted that some of the boxes represent places that officers routinely cover, but many others are places that might not otherwise receive attention.

       " 'What PredPol is and What PredPol is NOT: What is PredPol?: The National Institute for Justice explains that \"predictive policing tries to harness the power of information, geospatial technologies and evidence-based intervention models to reduce crime and improve public safety. This two-pronged approach -- applying advanced analytics to various data sets, in conjunction with intervention models -- can move law enforcement from reacting to crimes into the realm of predicting what and where something is likely to happen and deploying resources accordingly.\" What PredPol is NOT: Predictive policing is more than traditional hotspot mapping. Predictive Policing\\'s forecasting technology includes high-level mathematics, machine learning, and proven theories of crime behavior, that take a forward-looking approach to crime prevention. In fact, a 6 month randomized controlled trial found that crime analysts using PredPol technology in addition to their existing tools are twice as effective as experienced crime analysts using hotspot mapping alone. While PredPol\\'s predictive boxes predict that a crime will happen in the prediction area, there is no guarantee that an incident or arrest will occur. AND THAT\\'S THE POINT! The presence of police officers in the prediction areas creates a deterrence and suppression effect, thus preventing crime in the first place.

Carlsbad officials said last week they recently agreed to start using PredPol software early next year in an effort to reduce crime and deploy the department\\'s 110 officers more effectively. The software is based on the idea that if police can more often be in the right place at the right time, many crimes would get solved while they happen or not take place at all... Using mathematical formulas that can help predict the locations of earthquake aftershocks, PredPol gives police officers maps showing where future crimes are likely to take place. The software combines data about past crimes with universal trends in criminal activity and other information from local police, such as where a set of streetlights has burned out. While virtually all law enforcement agencies study patterns of where and when past crimes occurred, PredPol uses algorithms -- step-by-step mathematical calculations -- to look ahead. \"They\\'re looking at crime through a rearview mirror and we\\'re looking through the front windshield\" said Ryan Coonerty, PredPol\\'s director of government relations and strategy. \"It\\'s been shown to be a little more than twice as effective.\" In the Foothill area of Los Angeles in 2012, more than 6 percent of crimes took place within areas on maps created by PredPol, while only 3 percent happened in locations mapped by Police Department analysts. That year, overall crime was down 12 percent in the Foothill area, with department officials crediting PredPol for part of the drop. Meanwhile, burglaries were down 19 percent when Santa Cruz began using the software in 2012. Coonerty said predictive policing is the next evolution in crime fighting, describing it as an advance similar to community policing in the 1960s and the CompStat system for analyzing past crime data in the 1990s.

If you have your AVL system integrated with PredPol, boxes on the map will now update with a yellow or green check marks to reflect how much they have been dosed. No checkmark means the box has yet to be visited, yellow means it has been visited at least once, and green means that enough time has been spent in that box for the current shift. You now have the ability to toggle between seeing boxes for today\\'s shifts vs. yesterday\\'s shifts on the main map interface. The shift indicator has been updated to show whether you\\'re seeing boxes for the shift starting today, or yesterday , as displayed below: Click on the dotted underline text to flip between today and yesterday. This lets you see the boxes for a shift that has just ended. Combined with dosage flags, you can quickly determine if all of the recommended areas were dosed at the end of a shift. Please note: \"today\" and \"yesterday\" refer to the date that the shift started. If you have a shift that spans midnight, then in the early morning hours at the end of the shift you will be seeing \"yesterday\\'s\" shift. These new features will allow command staff to have more insight into where their patrol officers are going during their given shifts and if they have been dosing the prediction boxes for the appropriate amount of time. This information helps command staff to optimize their patrol operations and to provide real-time visibility into officer performance during their shift.

       " 'Feature Spotlight: NEW Patrol Heat Map!: PredPol has made some significant new changes to our Patrol Heat Map feature. We have improved the color display scheme, added the ability to view the data underlying the boxes, and provided the capability to download box patrol data.   What the Patrol Heat Map does is aggregate all AVL/GPS data from all cars on patrol, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The colors on the heat map are based on a relative scale and represent the total time measured for all officer presence in each box location. These boxes are 500 x 500 feet and cover the entire jurisdiction under patrol. The brighter colors represent more patrol time and darker colors represent less patrol time. The data can be used as a management tool to see which areas of your jurisdiction could be under-patrolled or over-patrolled. Data can be used internally and shared externally. The underlying data we provide increases departmental accountability and transparency for patrol operations. You can access the heat map same as before, through the Map Layers icon in the upper right side of the display from the main page. After you click on this, you have several options. Click on the rightmost icon, labeled Patrol Heat Map. Clicking on the Patrol Heat Map button displays the heat map for your selected region at the default level of 7 days. From this menu, you have several options. You can change the time period displayed by clicking on the date field. Options range from a single day to a custom historical time period. Clicking on the icon below the date field allows you to change the patrol area you\\'re looking at. You can see a city/county-level summary (default), or drill down to look at specific beats. Below that icon is a button labeled \"Plasma.\" That is the default color scheme used to illustrate the relative box time. If you click on that you will see 4 more color options (Viridis, Magma, Warm and Cool) that you can use according to your preference. The data presented by any of these color schemes is the same; the only difference is the color palette. You may want to make these boxes more or less transparent. Below the icon labeled Plasma you will see a slider bar. You can move that to the left or right to make the boxes more or less transparent according to your preferences. The default is 50%. The scale below the slider bar shows the legend for the map. Boxes with less time are at the top and boxes with more time are at the bottom. Next to each box color is the amount of time associated with each. Be aware that the boxes showing the most patrol time may often be your main station or substations. Now, on to the boxes themselves. When you hover your mouse over any box on the map, it will show the total time for that box immediately below the slider bar. When you click on a single box, you will get all of the patrol detail for that box. This is supplemented by a Google Street View map of the box location when available. In the example above, you can see that 47 different vehicles have been in this box location over the last week. The total time spent in this box (the \"Total Dosage\" field) is 14 hours, 33 minutes and 33 seconds. The data is arranged with the highest dosage vehicles at the top of the list. You can also see how many times they have been to that box. You can scroll down the list to see all vehicles and their associated dosages. Click on the PDF or CSV icons to export this data in PDF or CSV format. Let\\'s say you want to find out more information about device 501A on the list. When you click on 501A, it shows you that this device has had 12 visits to this box in the last week. These visits are sorted by date from oldest to newest. Only the first 2 dates are shown in this image; you can scroll down to see more recent dates. If you click on the first date with 6 visits, we display the underlying data that makes up those visits. This data is very granular and includes date, begin time, end time, and duration. At each level of review of this data, you can download it as a PDF or CSV by clicking on the associated icons. Let\\'s say you want to see data for more than 1 cell. To do that, you go back over to the Patrol Heat Map menu and click the button marked \"Multiple\" at the bottom of the menu. This now allows you to select more than one box and summarize all the patrol data underlying these boxes. Typical examples might include a shopping center, a stretch of road, a perimeter, an apartment complex, or a neighborhood. In the example below, we are looking at total patrol time across 6 boxes on E. Chicago St. You can see that in the last week there have been 58 unique vehicles that have visited this stretch of road. The total amount of patrol time was 9:51:41 and there were 1,063 unique visits. As with a single box, you can drill down by device and date to get the low-level detail associated with these visits. You can combine the Patrol Heat Map with other features Map Layers features. In the image below, patrol time for the last week is overlaid with crimes recorded over the last week. You can use this to see if there are areas with high crime rates that show up as being under-patrolled. Enjoy our new and enhanced Patrol Heat Map and let us know how you\\'re using it!

       " \"No Room in the Budget for PredPol? Learn How to Write a Grant to get Extra Funding!: Grant Writing: See why it's Essential and How to start the Process There are many departments that get additional funding from grants. Each year your agency gets a budget, but that doesn't necessarily cover all your departmental costs. Things also come up during the year that require additional funding like training or equipment - or PredPol! If your city or county is unwilling to provide additional funds, grants can be a great way for departments to get the funding they need to help cover these extra costs. It doesn't matter what size your department is, grants are beneficial and worth the effort.  How do You Know What Grant is Right for Your Agency? You may have to do some research first in order to find the right grant that will meet your department's needs. There are different categories you need to be aware of as well. Such categories include safety, human services, and environmental needs. Each grant has its own particular requirements that must be met in order for your agency to be eligible for funding. For example, if you find a grant that's right for your department but you've missed the submission cut off date, you either need to find a different grant or wait until it is open again. Time to Get Writing. Now What? When writing a grant proposal, there are five main factors to consider: departmental needs, approach, estimated outcomes, and additional funding in the future. 1- Departmental Needs. Discuss the needs of your department in depth. Talk about the issues you're experiencing, threat assessments, or vulnerabilities. Providing examples of results you've seen from other jurisdictions and discussing why now is the right time to address these needs is very helpful. PredPol can help provide you with success stories from other agencies.  2- Approach. This is when you talk about how the money will be spent, so make sure to be specific. You need to be able to describe how the project is going to help and why your approach is the best solution. You may also need to discuss other options you have evaluated and why they won't work (or have not been working).  3- Estimated Outcomes. Write out a list of benefits that you predict will be a result of your project, including any metrics or goals you plan to meet. Be sure that these are measurable, as you will need to report back at the end of the project, on the progress that was made. Some of these will be simpler to measure than others. They can include reduced rates of specific crime types, fewer calls for service, less overtime for your officers, better community relations, and so on.  4- Additional Funding for the Future. Just because you received the initial funding to kickstart a specific project doesn't mean that it won't need to be maintained. Make sure you also discuss what you plan to do once this first project ends. It is important that there is a long-term plan for your project so that those making the final decision know that you have thoroughly planned everything out. PredPol is an annual service, so you may include in your plans the fact that you will ask your city or county for funds the following year after you have proved that your approach is yielding measurable results. 5- Attention to Detail. The best advice you can get for grant writing is to look over the applications and lists of questions carefully. If it asks for exact information, make sure that you include it. Do not just submit the same narrative for each grant. Not answering the basic questions or including the exact information they ask for is a sure-fire way to get your proposal rejected. It is important to read over each grant's requirements thoroughly and adjust your writing accordingly.    Stay On It! We get it, grant writing isn't simple and fun. Just because a proposal is submitted, there is no guarantee you will get the money. Often, there are several departments applying for the same grant which means it can get very competitive. The best way to get funding is to keep the process streamlined and organized. A great way to do that is to assign the grant process to one specific person within the department. This makes it easier to ensure deadlines and requirements are met and proposals are submitted correctly. It takes time and perseverance, but it's worth the effort so that your department receives the funding it needs. And finally - don't forget to ask PredPol for help!

       " 'PredPol and Community Policing: The term \"community policing\" has been around for a while, at least since the 1980s. There have been a number of definitions over the years, but most of them reflect a similar theme. We can start with the US Department of Justice\\'s working definition:  \"Community policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that supportthe systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively addressthe immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as crime, social disorder,and fear of crime.\" But to PredPol community policing is so much more than that. Community policing is a philosophy that changes a department\\'s strategy from reacting to crime to crime prevention. We find that more and more agencies are beginning to adopt the philosophy of community policing and are transforming their departments by implementing a more proactive style of policing.  Since proactive policing is at the heart of what PredPol does, there are several ways we can help your agency\\'s efforts to implement community policing. Community PartnershipsCollaborative partnerships between your agency and other public safety and city stakeholders  help to develop solutions, establish transparency, and increase trust. By using PredPol\\'s Patrol Operations Management tools and analytics reports your agency can share customized crime reports and patrol data with other public safety officials within your city and the community. PredPol can also predict for other public-safety events, such as traffic collisions and drug overdoses, allowing your agency to work with other governmental and non-governmental entities to proactively address the complex problems facing our cities today. Organizational TransformationUsing a patrol operations management solution like PredPol, command staff can establish a stronger sense of accountability as they change their departmental culture to establish a more proactive approach to policing. Crime analysts and command staff can set missions by time of day and day of week, allowing officers to focus on reducing specific crime types. Our patrol heat map and dosage flags allow command staff to see where their officers are patrolling in real time to ensure they are focused on the areas where their efforts will be most effective at deterring crime. This data can help command staff set a baseline for performance expectations. The alignment of organizational management, structure and personnel can help an agency achieve a more effective and efficient way of policing. The ability to clearly define missions and communicate those missions to the community is an important element of building trust with the community. PredPol gives your command staff the ability to do this on an ongoing basis. Patrol Heat Map displaying vehicle dosage. Problem-Oriented PolicingThe process of engaging in the proactive examination of identified problems can help to develop and evaluate effective responses. PredPol\\'s analytics dashboard allows you to analyze how current patrol operations are affecting crime rates, which can provide valuable information on how to optimize your existing resources. This will help you to develop solutions to bring about lasting reductions in crime rates. Being able to have access to all of this data gives you the ability to assess the success of established missions and therefore adjust operationally if need be. By focusing on missions and \"hotspot\" locations, PredPol guides your officers to the locations where they can actively work to address underlying issues that can drive public safety events. If the current mission is to deter auto theft, officers may talk to people in the neighborhood or the staff at local stores nearby about how to mitigate risk. If the mission is to reduce residential burglary, officers may work with local community leaders to install security cameras or encourage residents to set up a neighborhood watch group. The specific problem-solving tactics are up to the departmental policies or the officers themselves. What PredPol can do is tell them where those efforts will have the greatest payoff. ',\n",
       " 'CBS News Highlights Norcross PredPol Crime Reductions (CBS ATLANTA) - by Will Frampton Four months after police in Norcross implemented a software program that predicts where crimes are likely to occur each day, they say the crime numbers in that time period suggest the program is working. \"We have seen anywhere from 15 to 30 percent in reduction in burglaries and robberies,\" said Lt. Bill Grogan. \"I don\\'t care how science fiction or how far out there it is, the proof is in the pudding.\" The program was developed by researchers at UCLA. Grogan said his department is the first in the Southeast to use it, and his officers have reported several instances where they made arrests thanks to cues from the software. It predicts crime in specific areas, every 12 hours. The predictions are based on crime history over the last three years, and take into account time of day and time of year. Atlanta police began testing the program in July, and rolled it out across the entire department in November. \"You\\'ll be seeing more and more of this,\" said Grogan.

       " '5 Common Myths About PredPol: Predictive policing is a broadly defined term, and for many people, one that invokes a distinct feeling of unease. Movies like \"Minority Report\" and recent news do little to ease those fears. In this post we debunk some of the most common myths you might have heard about PredPol and our predictive policing solution.  Myth #1 - PredPol is Profiling: PredPol only collects the following data from an agency\\'s records management system (RMS) to produce predictions. This information is collected directly from the victim of the crime itself. The only items of information we collect are: Notice that we\\'re not collecting anything else about the victim and nothing at all about an alleged perpetrator. We DO NOT use demographic, economic, or any kind of potential \"profiling\" information about the location or neighborhood where the incident took place. The what-where-when information from the RMS is all our model needs and nothing more. Myth #2 - Predictions Guarantee a Crime or Arrest. Despite our name, PredPol doesn\\'t actually \"predict\" crimes. What we do is process large datasets of victimization information to find the highest-risk locations for specified crimes types for each day and shift. When officers are on patrol, their presence is likely to have the greatest deterrent effect in these PredPol-designated areas. Deterrence is the ultimate goal - that means no crime, no victim, and nobody to arrest.  Myth #3 - PredPol requires major time and financial requirements from agencies. PredPol is extremely user friendly and can be used on any internet-enabled device, including smartphones, tablets and MDTs. It takes very little training before officers are using it effectively out in the field.  PredPol can make every dollar spent on patrol in your department more effective. Proactively patrolling areas where crimes are most likely to occur has been proven to reduce the incidence of those crimes. Reducing even one instance of one of type of crime can free up two or more hours of an officer\\'s patrol time. In other words, reducing just one crime per shift can add another 2 hours of effective patrol time. That\\'s like getting a 20% increase in your patrol staff for a fraction of the cost! Myth #4 - PredPol ONLY does predictions. Think of PredPol as more of a patrol management solution. Yes, we provide you with predictions, but just as importantly we help you to optimize your patrol operations by providing you with actionable insight. Our GPS and patrol heat map features show command staff exactly where their officers patrol and how much time they\\'ve spent in a specific area during their shift. And now, with our new Custom Boxes feature, we\\'ve added another level of control and transparency. Command officers can augment PredPol\\'s patrol recommendations with their own custom patrol areas for special events or assignments. This degree of transparency into patrol operations has given agencies a more objective way to manage their officers. Our robust analytics and reporting dashboard allows command staff to define missions, assign targeted patrol areas to officers, monitor their performance and ultimately measure their crime-prevention impact. When you deploy PredPol, you add 3 valuable tools to your agency: prediction boxes to guide your officers, GPS/AVL tracking to manage your resources in the field, and analytics to measure results and help you plan future missions.  Myth #5 - PredPol is a burden to officers. Actually just the opposite! PredPol reduces the burden on officers because we guide them where to patrol; they no longer have to wonder where their patrol time is going to be the most effective. We suggest an officer spend 6 minutes per hour, about 10% of patrol time, in PredPol boxes for an optimum balance between time spent and crime reduction. Want to learn more? ',\n",
       " 'PredPol Featured on NBC Chicago: Story by: Phil Rodgers Chicago police have successfully put a dent in what was a soaring murder rate in 2012 by flooding problem areas with officers and an overtime bill that topped $90 million this year. But what if a police department could fight crime with existing manpower by knowing where crimes are going to happen before they happen? Science fiction, or fact? To a company called PredPol in Los Angeles, it is very much a reality. The company\\'s computer systems generate maps with tiny red boxes which they say are the most likely locations where crimes are about to occur. \"The box is saying, \\'Here\\'s a location where the risk of crime is greater today, than any place else on the landscape,\\'\" explained UCLA professor Jeff Brantingham, one of PredPol\\'s founders. \"You can spend five minutes here and have a better chance of disrupting crime than being anywhere else, even if there\\'s other places that had crimes yesterday or the day before.\" Indeed, PredPol\\'s researchers say they have found that hitting spots where crime occurred a day earlier may not be the wisest strategy. PredPol crunches 10 years of crime data and current statistics, which may have been generated in the preceding few hours, to generate its own predictions of the exact locations where police are most needed. And those boxes are small: just 500 feet square. That\\'s about the size of a single apartment complex, or a shopping center parking lot. \"It\\'s ok to be skeptical,\" Brantingham says, \"because predictive policing sounds like it doesn\\'t work.\" But PredPol\\'s researchers, and in fact, its users, say it does work. It uses a complicated algorithm originally written to predict earthquakes to make the deployment of patrol officers as precise as possible. \"This is straight out mathematics,\" says Los Angeles Captain Sean Malinowksi, who helped develop PredPol and helmed a six month pilot program in the Foothill District on L.A.\\'s northeast side. \"We had a 25 percent decrease in burglary for that six months, versus that same six months a year ago,\" Malinowski said. \"And overall, we had a 12 percent reduction in the targeted crimes.\" Not only does PredPol sound like something out of the movies, it also goes against the traditional law enforcement methods of keeping score. And Malinowski said that means a change in the expectations of officers on the street. \"While your whole career you\\'ve been credited for big arrests,\" Malinowski notes, \"we\\'d like you to turn that a little bit on its head and prevent the crime from occurring in the first place.\" \"The outcome for us is lower crime, not number of arrests made,\" he said. Right now, Los Angeles is only using PredPol for property crimes. It has recently been rolled out in Seattle and Atlanta as well. But the program\\'s creators say they believe it can be just as effective in predicting violent crimes, including murder. \"Surprisingly enough, gun crime is just as predictable as property crimes,\" Brantingham says. Chicago is not a client. But PredPol\\'s founders ran Chicago crime data as an exercise. Thousands of pieces of information on gun seizures, assaults, batteries, robberies, and murders were fed in. And they say the results were impressive. Using PredPol boxes covering about 10 percent of the city, the program accurately predicted more than half of the murders which actually occurred. The researchers concede that\\'s a high coverage area. By contrast, Los Angeles only generates about 20 of the tiny boxes per district. Still, Brantingham says the seeming randomness of a passion-driven crime like murder can be predicted. \"Even though it seems to be random to the victims, it\\'s not random at all,\" he says. \"You can still predict two to two-and-a-half times more gun crime using this than what you would be able to do with existing practice.\" Closer to home, police in suburban Elgin have been using PredPol, mostly for property crimes, since the first of the year. A spokesman said the department has not yet quantified numbers on its performance. But in Los Angeles, what was a pilot program has now been rolled out citywide. \"When you drive a black and white through a PredPol box, you can assume that you are likely seeing the bad guy,\" says L.A. Captain John Romero. \"And the bad guy is seeing you.\" A Chicago Police Department spokesman said while they are not using the technology, they do employ other methods to try to stay ahead of violent crimes. \"We are engaged in several predictive efforts, including two funded through the National Institute of Justice,\" said spokesman Adam Collins. \"It\\'s a predictive analytic data set that tells us who is most likely to be involved in a violent crime, either as a victim or offender, based on their criminal history and their criminal network.\" \"We use this list to make those individuals aware of their significantly higher likelihood of being involved in violence,\" he said. \"Make them aware of the fact that they are eligible for enhanced penalties due to their background, and also work to help get them out of a life of violence.\"',\n",
       " 'Predictive Policing Leads to Large Drop in Burglaries Reported burglaries have fallen by 13 percent or more in areas of Santa Cruz County, bucking a South Bay trend of a rise in burglaries in recent months. In fact, burglaries in most parts of Santa Clara County have risen over the last year, some over 30 percent. In the city of Santa Cruz, reported residential and business burglaries dropped 14 percent from January to June 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. Meanwhile, Santa Clara County cities such as San Jose, Sunnvyale and Palo Alto have seen burglaries increase 30 percent or more in the same period. Law enforcement leaders over the hill said reduced police staffing has led to more of a focus on violent crime and less attention to property crimes. Yet Santa Cruz police spokesman Zach Friend said all agencies are facing more work with fewer resources. The question is how to deal with it. \"Even with staffing reductions, you have to look at new ways to cope,\" Friend said. If police don\\'t catch burglars, \"You can expect that person will go back to that hunting ground,\" he said. \"We think it\\'s important that we still apply resources to property crimes.\" Friend credited Santa Cruz police\\'s predictive policing system (PredPol), which places officers in city areas at specific times based on earlier property crimes. Since Santa Cruz police started it in July 2011, property crime has dropped overall, Friend said. This article originally ran in the San Jose Mercury News.',\n",
       " 'PredPol Partners LAPD-Foothill Records Day Without Crime! Early PredPol adopters Los Angeles Police (Foothill Division) recorded a day without reported crime - the first known instance of such an event. The following comes from the LAPD Media Advisory: On Thursday, February 13, 2014, LAPD\\'s Foothill Area recorded ZERO Part I crimes for the 24 hour period. This is the first time we have had a \"day without (recorded) crime\" in Foothill in recent memory and it may actually be the first time in our fifty year history where we had no crimes reported to the police. This is a tremendous achievement and a milestone for Foothill Area. To record zero crimes in a 24 hour period in a 50 square mile area of the San Fernando Valley, home to more than 250,000 people, is a tribute to the partnership and teamwork between the police and the public that we have formed over the last few years and an endorsement of the dogged determination of the police officers, detectives and civilian personnel that strive every day to make Foothill Area a safer place to live, work and play. By working closely with community groups, elected officials, other police agencies and social service providers the LAPD\\'s Foothill Area has been able to decrease crime significantly over the last five years. Crime has decreased steadily each year since 2009.  Part I or serious crime has been reduced from nearly 5,000 crime victims in 2009 to 3,800 for 2013, a 23% reduction. Violence is down even more dramatically from 888 victims of violence in 2009 to 510 last year.  That means that 378 fewer people in the communities of Pacoima, Sun Valley and Sunland-Tujunga have been touched by violence in our streets. And the trend is continuing this year. So far in 2014, crime is down 29% year-to-date. That equates to 150 fewer victims this year versus last year at this time... New data driven techniques have also contributed to these declines including the use of a risk based deployment forecasting program from Santa Cruz-based PredPol, Inc. a predictive policing software firm; investigative analysis software designed by Palantir, another silicon valley company and real time data visualization and analysis tools from a partnership between LAPD, the Los Angeles County Sheriff and a San Diego-based tech company called the Omega Group. The use of advanced data analytics allows Foothill Area to place officers in the right place at the right time to prevent crime. The use of Predictive Policing here is a place-based prevention strategy that does not use arrest data and is not arrest-based at all.  In fact, we have seen a decrease in arrests during the pilot testing that we have done.',\n",
       " 'PredPol Receives Significant International Coverage Over the last few weeks PredPol, the predictive policing company, has received a significant amount of international coverage from their product deployment in Kent (the United Kingdom) and interest by agencies throughout Europe.  Here are excerpts from an article that ran in the Gravesend Reporter in England. \"Predicting the future is standard practice for weather forecasters, economists, think tanks and business. Now the police are finding their own way of mapping crime before it even happens...The software, PredPol - which stands for predictive policing - has been brought to north Kent straight from California for its first trials in the UK. In Santa Cruz and Los Angeles, where the software was first tested in 2011, crime dropped by 27 per cent and 12 per cent respectively in the first six months.It began as an academic project seven years ago involving mathematicians, social scientists and an anthropology professor whose goal was to understand how crime hot spots occur. They found that by using a mathematical algorithm similar to one for predicting earthquake aftershocks they could create predict where crimes would happen. Speaking to The Reporter Jeff Brantingham, anthropology professor at the University of California, explains: \"When there is an earthquake you see a lot about how it produces aftershocks. In general they occur near in time and place to a main shock. Crime is very much the same. It you look at crime hotspots they appear quickly and spread around. When a burglar breaks into a house it makes the chance of crime occurring close by much more likely.\" The PredPol software maps years of past crime data and is updated daily with the location, time and type of crime committed. From this it creates prediction boxes of precise 500 sq ft zones which are listed in priority order as to where crimes are most likely to occur, which is then delivered to the smart phones, tablets and PCs of police officers who use it to make decisions on where to deploy. Steve Clark, deputy chief of police at Santa Cruz Police Department told The Reporter: \"Every officer knows where they can go on their beat and likely make an arrest but a predictable habit can form. Sometimes that primal policing sense is right and sometimes it is not. PredPol doesn\\'t replace an officer\\'s intuition but rather adds science to those skills.\"',\n",

The LAPD is using a high tech crime-fighting technique known as \"predictive policing\" and it seems to have scored its biggest success. Police said they enjoyed a day without crime on Feb. 13 in the LAPD\\'s Foothill Division, which stretches 50-square miles from Pacoima to Sunland Tujunga. Capt. Sean Malinowski, of the LAPD\\'s Foothill Division, credits the new tool for the lull. It disrupts crime, he said, with burglaries plunging from 132 last year to 58 this year. In predictive policing, computer algorithms take data from specific kinds of crime -- burglary, auto theft and car break-ins -- then map them out for officers. Areas with the most such crimes --  cops can see 500-square foot \"boxes\" -- get more attention by cops on the beat. Police are using the information they gather to go to the neighborhoods where certain crimes are predicted to go down. But police admit there remains a concern about the possibility of profiling. \"It doesn\\'t tell us anything about race, gender anything like that,\" said Chief Mark Yokoyama, of the Alhambra Police Department.

Shades of the 2002 Tom Cruise futuristic action thriller Minority Report? Well, in a way yes. No \\'precogs\" are being tethered to a computer yet, but some police agencies south of the border are experimenting with analytics technologies and what is being called predictive policing. For example, for the last seven years the PredPol algorithm developed by a team of mathematicians and social scientists at the University of Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Santa Clara and UC Irvine, has been analyzing crime incident information to some members of the Los Angeles Police predict where certain types of property-related crimes are most likely to happen during certain police patrol shifts. Similar experiments in police precincts in New York and Boston using other technologies have also been carried out. As the PredPol Web site states, its mission is simple: \"Place officers at the right time and location to them the best chance of preventing crime. The technology is designed to predict where crimes are likely to occur in place-based \"prediction boxes\" as small as 500\\' x 500\\'. PredPol is a secure, cloud-based, software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform. Crime data, specific to crime type and specific to police shifts is mapped into it instantaneously as the information is reported to the system. Its developers say PredPol is built around the same technology used to predict earthquakes. Crimes, they said, occur along fault line and happen in predictable patterns much like earthquakes. The PredPol report is shared is distributed to police during the roll call and call also be delivered to officers in the form of a paper report on transmitted to their smart phones or tablet devices. While traditional crime analysis tools such as ComStat provide a \"rear view mirror policing\" by mapping past crime to come up with \"some hints at the future,\" PredPol tells the police where crime is likely to happen in the near future. For example, the model can actually predict the risk of a crime in one location for the next 10 to 12 hours even if the latest crime reported occurred in a different location, according to users.

Check out the article below: For ages, law enforcement officers have plotted crimes on maps as a way of tracking activity and focusing attention on critical areas.  In the \"old days\", color-coded push pins were used to manually mark activity in each given sector.  The latest tool takes this basic analytic model a step or two further.  Pred Pol - Predictive Policing - uses the same kind of algorithms used by seismologists to attempt to predict aftershocks.  It was developed by a team that included mathematicians, criminologists and anthropologists.  In use at five Los Angeles Police Department divisions, the system seems to be helping.  Crime has dropped off between 12 and 27 percent in areas where Pred Pol has been implemented. The system developer Jeff Brantingham of UCLA explains that data from repeat crime victims is constantly re-calibrated which produces dynamic, graphic patterns that go beyond what humans can produce.  Although I believe we too often undervalue the power of human intuition and human analytics, this is an interesting and powerful system.  I look forward to see where it goes.',\n",

Here is the link. Copy below: New computer software is helping Norcross police officers patrol the city in a new way, based on historical crime reports, time of day and weather patterns. The software is called Predictive Policing, known simply as Pred-Pol. \"It\\'s predicting the highest probable location so that we can better allocate where our resources are being deployed to,\" said Lt. Bill Grogan of the Norcross Police Department. They paid $6,000 to have the software tailored to their department. The program was developed by a group of professors at UCLA and takes into account the most recent 18 months of local police data, helping officers identify certain areas that are more at risk on some days than others. Some of the areas are known for high crime rates. Others, said Grogan, come as a surprise to officers who normally would not think to spend extra time there looking for criminal activity. \"These areas you may not have thought of,\" said Grogan, referencing a map with small red squares on it, highlighting potentially problematic spots. \"Specifically, the success we had the first day it was implemented was exactly one of those locations, where the officers would not have been there. No doubt about it, their words, they would not have been there had it not been for this prediction.\" On that first day of using Pred-Pol, Aug. 9, Grogan said one of his patrol units was already in one the neighborhoods that had been denoted by a red box. There, they were able to apprehend a suspect while he was in the midst of committing burglary, according to Grogan. \"I was baffled,\" he said. \"I could not have ever anticipated that we would have had such a quick success. And not only that one success, but two in the same day.\" Grogan said his officers will likely only spend a few extra minutes per day in the areas that are marked by the red boxes, which denote areas that are roughly 500 square feet in size.',\n",

Modesto sees double-digit drop in property crimes - lowest in three years http://t.co/xqoiOcWk2Y -- The Modesto Bee (@modbee) November 12, 2014 This year, Modesto has had a 20 percent reduction in home burglaries, a 13 percent reduction in commercial thefts, a 12 percent reduction in vehicle thefts, an 11 percent reduction in robberies and a 5 percent reduction in larceny. \"We are determined to drive down crime in Modesto by being more strategic with our resources and more engaged with our community, despite the fact that we\\'ve had a 25percent reduction in patrol staff and hefty budget cuts over the last year,\" said Police Chief Galen Carroll in a news release. The department has been using predictive policing data, trying to learn about areas hit by crime and when to patrol those areas. Police have combined that predictive policing with improving dialogue with Modesto residents through one-on-one conversations, social media and town hall meetings. The predictive policing software uses statistics and mathematical modeling to predict where crimes are likely to occur, down to an area as small as 500 by 500 feet. The software also is being used in such cities as Seattle and Los Angeles. \"With fewer resources at our disposal, we are fortunate to be able to better pinpoint where crime is likely to occur,\" Capt. Rick Armendariz said in the news release. \"We are finding we are now more often in the right place at the right time.\" The department began using the predictive policing software, called PredPol, in January. Police officials wanted to identify where to strategically deploy officers in the places and at the times crimes are most likely to occur. The software helps analysts and officers determine areas with the highest probability of a crime occurring, using an algorithm based on the location, time and date of past crimes. Police officials said it does not include any information about individuals or demographic groups. Jeff Brantingham is a co-founder of PredPol and an anthropology professor specializing in criminology at UCLA. He said in the news release that there is no single strategy that can eliminate crime altogether, but dozens of cities in the country are using predictive analytics to reduce crime and improve safety. \"We\\'re pleased, but not surprised with the results, as they are mirroring what we are seeing in other communities across the nation,\" Brantingham said about the recent decline in Modesto crime.',\n",
       " 'KMWorld Magazines Features PredPol KM on the crime beat In Santa Cruz, Calif., the police force has successfully reduced crime by nearly 20 percent in the past year, aided in part by a software product called PredPol, which predicts areas where crime is most likely to occur. \"We knew that getting more officers on staff was not a realistic option,\" says Zach Friend, crime analyst for the Santa Cruz Police Department (SCPD). \"We were looking for a way to allocate our resources more efficiently.\" In exploring software solutions that might help support resource allocation decisions, Friend came across a research report on a project that had brought together an interdisciplinary team, including an anthropologist and mathematicians, to develop models that reflected patterns of crime. \"The software had been tested on a sample of data but not in an operational setting,\" Friend says. \"We partnered with the research group to find out whether the software could be effective in a real-world setting, using the police reports in our records management system.\" Before moving forward with the effort, the SCPD tested the system by providing five years of information to PredPol and challenging it to predict a sixth year, for which the department already had information. \"The software predicted a significant percentage of crime for that year, so we decided to incorporate it into our operations,\" Friend adds. The SCPD spent about six months working with researchers to determine what the output of the analyses should look like, and launched the PredPol system in fall 2011. The software tracks residential and commercial burglaries, auto break-ins and auto theft. Likely \"hot spots\" Before each shift starts, a patrol sergeant or supervisor logs onto the system and the screen shows 15 \"hot spot\" locations outlined in a red box. A map is printed out that officers take with them on their patrol. \"We have 13 square miles to cover,\" Friend says. \"The software identifies the zones where we are most likely to have problems and therefore lets us use our resources better.\" Police reports are automatically run though the PredPol algorithm every hour to keep the system updated. In any given hour, an officer has approximately 15 minutes that is not dedicated to an activity such as responding to a 911 call or conducting pre-scheduled patrols. During that time, the officers move into the red box areas. In several dozen cases, that process has produced arrests by officers who were in the right place at the right time. However, the ultimate goal is to prevent crimes from occurring in the first place. \"The arrests provided good feedback that the system was working,\" Friend explains, \"but PredPol also reduced crime through prevention.\" PredPol, a SaaS product, eliminates the need for capital investment in software and is less expensive than a full-fledged business intelligence platform. It can be extended, however, and has the capability to perform additional analytics. Officers are now requesting that additional types of crime be built into the system, so the SCPD plans to expand its analyses into street crimes such as robberies and assaults. PredPol achieves a delicate balance between sophistication and usability. \"It was important not to increase the complexity of what officers already had to do on the street,\" says Jeff Brantingham, cofounder of PredPol and chief of R&D. \"Although the mathematics are complex, the \\'hot spot\\' boxes tell the officers in a straightforward way where they can have the greatest impact.\" The several hundred inquiries that the company has received from law enforcement agencies reflect the need for an affordable and effective solution to the challenge of reducing crime at a time when resources are tight.',\n",

Points of Interest (POIs) is a tool for adding your own internal information to the map. POIs provide different styles of markers that are displayed on the main map and offer the ability to attach additional information about specific locations directly to the map. Why is this important: With the ability to add custom information to specific locations on the map, command staff and analysts can provide officers with additional context to their patrol locations. You can even add hyperlinks to specific POI descriptions, allowing you to add live camera feeds if available for that location. This can provide command staff and officers out on patrol with real-time intelligence. In addition to live camera feeds, you can link POIs to photographs, documents, or even other web sites or applications to provide richer levels of detail. How to use POIs: In addition to the map, POIs are also displayed in the Data View when it is open. By default, the Data View contains every POI that is displayed on the map, but it can be filtered more by entering a search term in the \"Filter\" box on the upper right side of the Data View, right below the blue bar. Clicking \"Edit\" allows you to update fields in the POI. Clicking any of the markers opens up a window displaying the information contained within a POI. The details view shows the title of the POI, its description, and any hyperlinks that are associated with it (for instance to a web-based camera feed). Links can also be added from the details view by clicking the \"Add Links\" button. The search bar in the upper-right corner of the screen provides for flexible searching of POIs. The details of POI in the search results can be opened by clicking on the title of the result. The entire set of POIs from a search can be added to the map by clicking the \"Add Selected\" button.

The following provides an overview of the story by Martin Kaste. \"Typically, police arrive at the scene of a crime after it occurs. But rather than send cops to yesterday\\'s crime, a new trend in law enforcement is using computers to predict where tomorrow\\'s crimes will be -- and then try to head them off. The software uses past statistics to project where crime is moving. Police in Los Angeles say it\\'s worked well in predicting property crimes there. Now Seattle is about to expand it for use in predicting gun violence. It all started as a research project. Jeff Brantingham, an anthropologist at UCLA, wanted to see if computers could model future crime the same way they model earthquake aftershocks. Turns out they can. \"It predicts sort of twice as much crime as any other existing system, even going head-to-head with a crime analyst,\" Brantingham says. Older systems, like the famous CompStat in New York, show where crime has been. This system looks forward. \"The model will actually predict other locations, that effectively say, even though there was a crime somewhere else in your environment, the risk is still greatest in this location today for the next 10 hours or the next 12 hours,\" Brantingham explains. Brantingham and his colleagues are now selling the predictive system to police departments with the name PredPol. At this point, you may be thinking about the sci-fi movie Minority Report. But this is different. No psychics sleeping in bathtubs, for one. More to the point, this doesn\\'t predict who will commit a future crime, just where it is likely to happen. In Seattle, police Sgt. Christi Robbin zooms in on a map of the city. Earlier this year, Seattle started using PredPol to predict property crimes. It\\'s now the first place to try predicting gun violence with the software. \"These red boxes [on the map] are predictions of where the next crimes are likely to occur,\" Robbin explains. At the start of every shift, patrol cops are assigned to those red boxes. \"So we\\'re asking that they spent the time in that 500-by-500-square-foot box, doing whatever proactive work they can to prevent that crime,\" Robbin says. On a recent shift, officer Philip Monzon pulls up inside his box; today, it\\'s a city block near the Seattle waterfront. \"[The police] want visibility, they want contacts with businesses as are appropriate, and anyone who\\'s wandering through the area,\" Monzon explains.

       " 'Policing in the Time of Covid-19: Law enforcement patrol operations are based to a large degree on habit. Criminals tend to operate in zones where they feel comfortable, where the rewards outweigh the risks. The well-established criminological theory of repeat and near-repeat behavior confirms this across different crime types, from burglaries to vehicle crimes to violent crime. Officers tend to fall into patrol habits as well, whether intentionally or unintentionally. Intentional habits include patrolling areas that are perceived to be crime hotspots based on past experience or the analysis of crime data. These habits can also include officer judgment based on his or her knowledge and experience of the patrol area. Unintentional habits are harder to self-identify. Humans fall into patterns of behavior throughout their daily lives: the route you take to drive to work, where you get coffee or gas, how and when you exercise. The challenge for law enforcement is that someone intending to engage in criminal activity can recognize these patterns and act accordingly. As Sheldon F. Greenberg notes in his book \"Frontline Policing in the 21st Century\" (2017): \"Falling into repeated patterns and practices has always been among a patrol officer\\'s greatest weaknesses and threats. Repeated patterns are easily spotted by others and can be used to their advantage.\" This was one of the founding principles of PredPol: using large datasets of historical crime data allows officers to detect and get ahead of future patterns of criminal behavior. They can proactively patrol those areas and prevent crimes before they occur. How much does the current outbreak of Covid-19 change all this? Just one week into shelter in place provisions, we are already starting to see changes in long-term historical crime patterns (note: this is still a small time sample of data). In PredPol cities that are subject to shelter-in-place orders, we are seeing - as you would expect - a decline in residential burglaries, as more people stay at home. Commercial burglaries, on the other hand, appear to be increasing. Traffic collisions are way down, since fewer people are driving. Vehicle crime rates appear to be declining somewhat, but the places and times where they are occurring seem to be moving away from traditional hotspots like shopping center parking lots, and the volume appears to be shifting away from daytime to evening and nighttime. This is where PredPol comes in really handy. The Covid-19 virus will change many things in our world before we have found a vaccine or cure for it. It may change how and where we work and go to school. It may change how some services, such as healthcare, are delivered. But it will also change the patterns of criminal behavior. Typical times of different crime types will change. Locations will change. The mix of crime types will change. It will be impossible without advanced analytics, it will be almost impossible to pick up those changes in real time. Using PredPol\\'s machine learning algorithm, however, departments will be able to recognize and react to those new patterns, and change their patrol patterns as well. ',\n",

But what if a police department could fight crime with existing manpower by knowing where crimes are going to happen before they happen? Science fiction, or fact? To a company called PredPol in Los Angeles, it is very much a reality. The company\\'s computer systems generate maps with tiny red boxes which they say are the most likely locations where crimes are about to occur. \"The box is saying, \\'Here\\'s a location where the risk of crime is greater today, than any place else on the landscape,\\'\" explained UCLA professor Jeff Brantingham, one of PredPol\\'s founders. \"You can spend five minutes here and have a better chance of disrupting crime than being anywhere else, even if there\\'s other places that had crimes yesterday or the day before.\" Indeed, PredPol\\'s researchers say they have found that hitting spots where crime occurred a day earlier may not be the wisest strategy. PredPol crunches 10 years of crime data and current statistics, which may have been generated in the preceding few hours, to generate its own predictions of the exact locations where police are most needed. And those boxes are small: just 500 feet square. That\\'s about the size of a single apartment complex, or a shopping center parking lot. \"It\\'s ok to be skeptical,\" Brantingham says, \"because predictive policing sounds like it doesn\\'t work.\" But PredPol\\'s researchers, and in fact, its users, say it does work. It uses a complicated algorithm originally written to predict earthquakes to make the deployment of patrol officers as precise as possible. \"This is straight out mathematics,\" says Los Angeles Captain Sean Malinowksi, who helped develop PredPol and helmed a six month pilot program in the Foothill District on L.A.\\'s northeast side. \"We had a 25 percent decrease in burglary for that six months, versus that same six months a year ago,\" Malinowski said. \"And overall, we had a 12 percent reduction in the targeted crimes.\" Not only does PredPol sound like something out of the movies, it also goes against the traditional law enforcement methods of keeping score. And Malinowski said that means a change in the expectations of officers on the street. \"While your whole career you\\'ve been credited for big arrests,\" Malinowski notes, \"we\\'d like you to turn that a little bit on its head and prevent the crime from occurring in the first place.\" \"The outcome for us is lower crime, not number of arrests made,\" he said. Right now, Los Angeles is only using PredPol for property crimes. It has recently been rolled out in Seattle and Atlanta as well. But the program\\'s creators say they believe it can be just as effective in predicting violent crimes, including murder. \"Surprisingly enough, gun crime is just as predictable as property crimes,\" Brantingham says. Chicago is not a client. But PredPol\\'s founders ran Chicago crime data as an exercise. Thousands of pieces of information on gun seizures, assaults, batteries, robberies, and murders were fed in. And they say the results were impressive. Using PredPol boxes covering about 10 percent of the city, the program accurately predicted more than half of the murders which actually occurred. The researchers concede that\\'s a high coverage area. By contrast, Los Angeles only generates about 20 of the tiny boxes per district. Still, Brantingham says the seeming randomness of a passion-driven crime like murder can be predicted. \"Even though it seems to be random to the victims, it\\'s not random at all,\" he says. \"You can still predict two to two-and-a-half times more gun crime using this than what you would be able to do with existing practice.\" Closer to home, police in suburban Elgin have been using PredPol, mostly for property crimes, since the first of the year. A spokesman said the department has not yet quantified numbers on its performance. But in Los Angeles, what was a pilot program has now been rolled out citywide. \"When you drive a black and white through a PredPol box, you can assume that you are likely seeing the bad guy,\" says L.A. Captain John Romero. \"And the bad guy is seeing you.\" A Chicago Police Department spokesman said while they are not using the technology, they do employ other methods to try to stay ahead of violent crimes. \"We are engaged in several predictive efforts, including two funded through the National Institute of Justice,\" said spokesman Adam Collins. \"It\\'s a predictive analytic data set that tells us who is most likely to be involved in a violent crime, either as a victim or offender, based on their criminal history and their criminal network.\" \"We use this list to make those individuals aware of their significantly higher likelihood of being involved in violence,\" he said. \"Make them aware of the fact that they are eligible for enhanced penalties due to their background, and also work to help get them out of a life of violence.\"',\n",
       " \"Not All Predictive Policing Is Created Equal-Here's Why:: Predictive policing is a phrase that raises concerns for many. The worry is that predictive policing could amplify biases and lead to unequal outcomes for individuals and communities. Some of this concern can be resolved by carefully explaining what predictive policing is and what it is not. Even with such careful explanation, predictive policing should be subject to high standards of accountability and openness. Society grants police extraordinary powers and anything that potentially impacts how those powers are exercised must be subject to such high standards. What It IS Predictive policing may be used to describe a range of different data-driven policing strategies. A way to understand this range is to ask first, what is being predicted and second, what data is being used for prediction. For the first question, the two broad alternatives are that you can try to predict who will commit a crime, or predict where and when a crime will occur. These are obvious alternatives and need little explanation. For the second question, the two broad alternatives are to use data related to crime risk factors, or data related to crime event histories. These alternatives may be less familiar so a brief explanation is in order. Crime Risk Factor A crime risk factor is some measured attributes of individuals, social groups, places or neighborhoods (anything really) that is correlated with the occurrence of crime, but is itself not illegal in nature. For example, socioeconomic disadvantage (poverty) has been known to correlate with crime since at least the 1830's. This has led many to think of poverty as somehow causally related to crime. By contrast, crime event histories reflect past behaviors that have been recorded as a violation of the law. The process that leads to the recording of a crime is certainly imperfect, but it is subject to a set of legal standards that risk factors NEVER are. These different pieces can be put together to arrive at a simple classification of the range of strategies that might be called predictive policing.  Types of Predictive Policing Risk factors used to predict who will commit a crime is a way of describing criminal profiling. Here non-criminal attributes of an individual and the community in which they live in are used to predict whether or not they will commit a crime in the future. Criminal profiling is rife with civil liberties problems and it is right to raise serious concerns about predictive policing that follows this model.  Risk factors used to predict where and when a crime will occur is a part of so-called risk terrain modeling. Here, non-criminal attributes of individuals, groups and places are analyzed in space and time to try to identify which places are at greatest risk of a crime occurring and when.  Though, perhaps subject to fewer civil liberties concerns because of the focus on place rather than person, a key challenge here is whether the correlations that underlie the model of risk are actually causal.   While we know that poverty is correlated with crime, there is limited agreement, let alone proof, of what drives the correlation.  If the correlation breaks it is difficult to figure out why, and more importantly, how it will impact predictions. Event Histories Using event histories to predict who will commit a crime might be termed intelligence-led prediction.  This is a much narrower idea than intelligence-led policing, which generally seeks to ingest as much information about individuals and police their explicit behavioral patterns.   Intelligence-led prediction is meant to refer to the idea of using only the past offending patterns of an individual to predict if and when they will likely commit a crime in the future. There is ample evidence to suggest that offending history follows regular trajectories, and seeking to intervene with individuals, given knowledge of their offending history, is a well-established practice.  Such methods have been used as part of the parole decision making process in some places.  However, acting on a prediction that someone might commit a crime does raise significant legal and ethical concerns. Finally, using event histories to predict where and when a crime may occur is termed placed-based predictive policing.  Here the history of crimes occurring in a place provide a record of how crime hotspots emerge, spread and dissipate.  Understanding these dynamics allows one to predict how those hotspots will evolve in the near future and where crimes are most likely to occur.  The focus is on place and NOT people, and uses recorded crimes, NOT assumptions about how different individual, social or environmental risk factors drive crime.   PredPol operates strictly in the place-based predictive policing domain. Event histories are assembled from crimes known to the police, specifically information on what type of crime occurred, where it occurred and when. No information on victims or suspects, nor measures of the characteristics of communities and environments, are used in predictions. This data is sufficient to identify a limited number of 500 x 500 foot regions where crimes are likely to occur in a window of time lasting anywhere from 6 to 12 hours. PredPol predictions typically predict two-times as much crime as traditional hotspot modeling, which relies on static crime locations and does not take into account the dynamic nature of crime. Police use these predictions as part of their routine patrol practice, visiting predicted crime places when they have available patrol time. \",\n",
       " 'Governing Magazine Features Santa Cruz Police and PredPol: From Governing Magazine: Full article can be found here: By: John M. Kamensky The use of data to investigate and solve crime certainly isn\\'t new: Crime mapping has been used by detectives since it was developed by an Italian geographer and a French mathematician in 1829. Today, however, new data, statistical tools and other advanced technologies are helping police departments across the country turn traditional police officers into \"data detectives\" who not only solve crime but predict it. \"Predictive policing\" is an adaptation of business techniques initially developed by retailers such as Netflix and Walmart to predict the behavior of consumers. In a new research report for the IBM Center for the Business of Government, Dr. Jennifer Bachner of Johns Hopkins University tells compelling stories of the experiences that several cities are having in using these cutting-edge crime-busting methodologies. The Santa Cruz, Calif., police department was one of the first in the United States to embed predictive policing into its regular day-to-day operations. During the pilot phase, which began in mid-2011, burglaries dropped by 27 percent when compared to the previous year. Since then, the department has increased arrests by 56 percent and recovered 22 percent more stolen cars. What did the Santa Cruz police do? The core of the program, writes Bachner, is \"the continuous identification of areas that are expected to experience increased levels of crime in a specified time-frame.\" The system divides a map of the city into 150-by-150-meter cells. Drawing upon a database of past criminal incidents, a computer algorithm assigns probabilities of crime occurring to each cell, giving greater weight to more recent crimes. Prior to their shifts, officers are briefed on the locations of the 15 cells with the highest probabilities and encouraged to devote extra time to monitoring these areas. \"It\\'s almost like Neighborhood Watch in the next century,\" Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark wrote in a local newspaper. Bachner lists three categories of analytic techniques that Santa Cruz and other police departments are using to predict and prevent various kinds of crime: Analysis of space. There are about a half-dozen \"hot spot\" detection methods. \"Point location,\" for example, involves mapping specific addresses where crimes have been reported and looking for patterns, since crime is more likely to happen near locations that have experienced it in the past. In \"hierarchical cluster\" analysis, crime incidents are grouped to prioritize patterns. And in \"density mapping,\" the resulting map looks similar to a topographical map. Analysis of both space and time. A second, and related, set of techniques goes a step further. For example, a software program called CrimeStat III, developed by the National Institute of Justice, permits examination of the path a criminal has taken. With Series Finder, being developed at MIT, \"an analyst can perform a correlated walk analysis ... which examines the temporal and spatial relationships between incidents in a given sequence to predict the next incident,\" writes Bachner. But while this approach works in theory, she says, it \"requires refinement before it can be regularly used by police departments.\" Analysis of social networks. This approach, aimed at determining persons of interest rather than locations of interest, is new but growing in importance in the new age of social media. Like all human institutions, organized crime and gangs depend on interpersonal relationships. There are a number of different statistical and visualization tools that have been developed to analyze social networks, and Bachner reports that the Richmond, Va., police department, working with Virginia Commonwealth University, has developed a successful pilot program to integrate social network analysis into crime-fighting. Bachner doesn\\'t suggest that predictive analytics -- in policing or in other policy areas -- is some kind of silver bullet. It is an additional tool that supplements existing methods. Community policing, for example, remains an important strategy for deterring crime. \"Nevertheless,\" she notes, \"policing, like many other fields, is undoubtedly moving in a data-driven direction.\" Of course, having the technology doesn\\'t mean it will get used. Analytic techniques such as hierarchical and partitioned clusters can be intimidating to non-analysts. Bachner found that getting buy-in from the on-the-street police officer was crucial and that \"it cannot be imposed on unwilling officers as a replacement for experience and intuition.\" But once officers begin using the tools of predictive policing to supplement their traditional approaches, she writes, they like the results.',\n",

       " '4 Factors to Consider When Investing in Technology: Paul Rosenzweig, former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security explained at the International Association of Chiefs of Police the four factors to consider when investing in a new technology for your police department. In this blog post we will explain how PredPol addresses these four factors. 1.) Cost: PredPol\\'s pricing follows our continued pursuit of simplicity and intuition. There are no hidden fees, unlimited users, and a yearly flat rate. PredPol requires no new hardware, no storage or data fees, and a dedicated 24-hour support staff. Deployment happens in matter of weeks with about 5 hours cumulative set-up time, and comprehensive and intuitive training with your staff. 2.) Determining and Managing Expectations: Data is stored in the cloud and at the fingertips of officers and analysts 24/7. Data is updated daily and automatically, which simplifies data collection and storage allowing more time for analysis and direction of resources. 3.) Planning for Privacy: PredPol\\'s predictions use only what, when, and where, which means there\\'s no profiling or identifying information. PredPol\\'s predictions enable more transparency when applied to community policing efforts, especially via social media. Knowing and sharing what crimes are expected, and where, garners citizen engagement and give officers opportunity to get out and interact in neighborhoods. (For more on PredPol\\'s support of community policing read our blog post). 4.) Security Implications:  Using PredPol\\'s prediction boxes means preventing a range of selected crime types based solely on your past crime data of what, when, and where. No personal data is collected, which eliminates concerns of profiling. PredPol ensures your data\\'s security with a combination of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard, a specification for encryption of electronic data established by the United States federal government) and RSA (a public-key cryptosystem used for secure data transmission). This combination creates a \"direct line\" to PredPol\\'s prediction servers, allowing the data pipe and PredPol\\'s prediction servers to communicate freely without the threat of interception.

       " 'Predictive Policing and Crime Displacement: The Myth of Crime Displacement: This post addresses the myth of crime displacement, which simply describes the expectation that crime moves from one area to another due to police prevention efforts. Some might think that if law enforcement\\'s crime prevention efforts are helping to deter crime in one area, that criminals will commit those crimes elsewhere. The research shows otherwise. When data-driven patrol takes away crime opportunities, most offenders opt to not commit the crime. Studies on criminology show that criminals often offend in the places where they are most comfortable. If there is repeated police deterrence, it reduces their willingness to offend in that location. Several other criminology studies disprove displacement theory - many dating as far back as 1993. A recent, National Institute of Justice study stated that, \"quantitative measures offer strong support for prior studies that show that focused crime prevention efforts are not likely to have large displacement effects to areas nearby. In this sense, crime does not seem to simply \"move around the corner\" as a result of hot spot policing efforts.\" Using data about when and where crimes have been committed in the past, PredPol provides patrol officers predictions that give them the best chance of denying opportunities for future crimes to occur, shift by shift. PredPol\\'s most recent study was conducted by the Atlanta Police Foundation after a predictive policing trial in 2013. Atlanta was broken up into six different policing \\'Zones\\' and different Part 1 crime types were used to measure PredPol\\'s predictive accuracy, crime reduction results, and effects on crime displacement. These charts show the average percentage of burglary & robbery crime within x distance from a PredPol box. The first rows display the 4 zones that were not deploying PredPol during the trial. The second rows display the 2 zones where PredPol was deployed: According to crime displacement theory, crime within x distance from a PredPol box in the 2 zones where PredPol is deployed should be higher than in the non-deployed zones, because PredPol is shifting crime \"around the corner\". After the trial period, the foundation\\'s six researchers concluded that PredPol reduced crime in zones that were deployed, and the \"hypothesized change in crime location did not occur\". Back in 2006, UCLA researchers created a mathematical computer simulation model of crime pattern formation. The model led them to identify two types of crime hot spots that react differently to increased policing - one that relocates and another that dissolves. The model revealed that when given additional policing, super-critical hot spots displace and form in adjacent regions because they\\'re developed from small crime spikes. \"You can\\'t just go and suppress all those small spikes in crime; you\\'re going to suppress the big hot spot,\" Brantingham said. \"The small spikes in crime that are out there in the environment are ready to nucleate into a new one.\" However, the larger, subcritical hot spots do not re-emerge after increased policing. :',\n",
       " 'The 5 Data Points that PredPol Uses From Your Agency\\'s Records Management System (RMS): PredPol uses data from your agency\\'s RMS to pull current and historical crime data. We then feed this into our machine-learning algorithm to create our predictions. We work with you and your RMS vendor to make sure that the data we use is accurate and complete.  Here are the 5 data points needed for each incident to generate our predictions: 1. Incident Identifier For each crime, we need a unique identifier, such as docket number, incident ID or anything else used by the department to uniquely identify the crime. 2. Crime Type The violation code and/or crime description assigned to a particular incident type as used in your RMS. 3. Location of Incident For best accuracy, latitude and longitude are desired. Your latitude and longitude must use the WGS 84 coordinate system. If latitude and longitude are not available, then the complete address of the incident is required. A complete address is Street Number, Street Name, City, State/Region. 4. Timestamps with Start and End Date/Time for Incident (format:  yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss) These are actually two fields: incident start date/time, and incident end date/time. We use these two fields because in some cases the exact date and time that the crime occurred is not known. For example, an auto theft may occur between midnight and 8 AM, or a burglary may occur over a weekend. Predpol calculates the incident occurrence time by taking the midpoint between beginning date/time and ending date/time. Incidents with a span of more than 72 hours between the beginning and ending date/time are excluded because it reduces the accuracy of our predictions. Predpol prefers the date and time are together as a timestamp column. 5. Record Modified Date/Time for Incident (format:  yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss) This is an options field, but if possible we also request that you include a \"record modified\" date/time field to allow us to catch RMS records that may have changed (i.e. crime code has been reclassified).

       " 'Prop 47 and Crime Rise: Proposition 47 was a ballot initiative that was passed in November of 2014 which changes the sentencing for certain non-violent crimes. The reception since has been varied. Some argue that there has been no affect on crime rates, while others claim rising crime rates cannot be ignored when weighing the proposition\\'s effect. Tracking Prop 47: Proposition 47 co-author Mike Romano says, \"Proposition 47 on crime rates is very difficult to figure out in the course of a year\" for many reasons. He explains that the time it takes to try a case is around a year, therefore most repeals have not yet happened, and that crime is going up around the country and that is not influenced by prop 47. Furthermore, he explains \"of the folks who have been released under Proposition 47 over the past year, very few have been returned to prison.\" The Public Policy Institute of California clarifies the amount of individuals released from incarceration: \"the prison population dropped by almost 5,000, to about 131,200 (or 340 inmates per 100,000 residents)\" in the proposition\\'s first 4 months. Lizzie Buchen with the Center on Criminal and Juvenile Justice claims that there is no correlation between the amount of citizens incarcerated and crime rates: \"Crime is a result of so many different things.

Community policing is one of the many aspects that contribute to successful modern policing. Our predictive policing technology has been integral in helping law enforcement agencies dramatically reduce crime in jurisdictions of all types and sizes, across the U.S. and overseas. Most policing issues cannot be solved with technology alone. A cornerstone of PredPol\\'s predictive policing is providing direction to patrol commanders and officers, thus enabling crime to be prevented in prediction areas, and not necessarily with an arrest, but by serving as a deterrent. \"It\\'s actually increased our communication and visibility to the community because [police officers are] spending more time in the residential area, as an example. I get calls all the time about why the police are in their neighborhood more.\" Chief Mark Yokoyama (SVG Journal) Helping to Strengthen Police & Community Ties: Policing today requires that agencies strengthen the relationships between local police and the communities they protect and serve. PredPol\\'s technology supports community policing efforts by increasing the visibility of officers in PredPol\\'s prediction areas. PredPol\\'s mission is simple: help communities reduce crime by predicting and preventing it. The goal of this mission is to support law enforcement in building safer communities. This results in fewer victims, thereby enhancing commerce, education, and community interaction to sustain a positive living environment. Predictive & Community Policing: For many jurisdictions, a predictive policing strategy encourages patrol officers to work as partners with communities in the locations where crime is most likely to occur. PredPol helps guide location-based strategies where officers communicate and build relationships with residents to engage them in community crime watch efforts. PredPol advises that patrol officers spend a few minutes in the predictive areas to strengthen community ties and deter crime when they\\'re not responding to calls for service or performing other duties. Some of these areas are places that officers routinely cover, but many others are places that might not otherwise receive attention. In addition to crime reduction results, most of our deployments notice an improvement in their community policing efforts. LAPD performs community policing by informing locals of their daily prediction areas and encouraging the involvement of citizens during their daily activities, like walking the dog. \"We also have to listen to the word on the street from our seasoned officers, from the arrestees, the detectives and the homeowners with whom we\\'ve established partnerships,\" Captain Stephen Carmona (NBC Los Angeles) Facilitating Public Trust: A major policing issue today has been the need to strengthen community policing and strengthen trust among law enforcement and the communities they serve.

       " 'Predictive Policing with Continued Results Law Enforcement agencies using PredPol\\'s predictive policing software continue to report crime reduction results in every region it is deployed. Using only three pieces of crime data -- what, when, and where crime occurred -- communities actively using PredPol have confirmed positive change. In Modesto, California, reported crime has shown decreases in home burglaries of 20%, commercial thefts reduced 13%, vehicle thefts down 12%, and robberies reduced 11%. PredPol has acted as a force multiplier for Modesto, aiding in crime reductions while their patrol staff and budgets were significantly reduced. Across the country in Reading, Pennsylvania, similar predictive policing results have been reported. Reading\\'s Police Department has seen reductions in burglaries of 18%, and auto thefts reduced as much as 30% since using PredPol. Combined with an innovative community policing program, PredPol has helped the department to focus on specific missions that can build a safer community. In addition to mass crime reductions, our partner agencies also report stories of crime prevention that happen on an individual level in prediction areas. For instance, in Kent, England, officers visited an area that was not considered a \"hot spot\" for crime, but PredPol\\'s patented algorithm led them there. Upon patrolling the prediction zone, officers discovered an abused woman and child. \"The officers managed to take care of them and also managed to apprehend the offender, who was a known and wanted suspect,\" says Mark Johnson, head of analysis at Kent police. Back in the United States, patrol officers in Atlanta, Georgia reported suspects in another PredPol box where robbery was likely to occur. The officer found a female whose purse had been stolen moments earlier at gunpoint, and the officer was able to detain and identify the suspects with the victim\\'s help. PredPol\\'s predictions helped lead the officer to the appropriate area, and apprehend the perpetrators. PredPol works best as a tool that assists veteran officers and analysts with their community policing efforts. Likewise, PredPol has continued to support community growth by working with local Bay Area outreach programs like Digital Nest and CSU Monterey Bay. Increasing community safety is about more than just reporting crime reductions, it is achieved through a combination of individuals cooperating with public safety organizations. PredPol is aware of this, and continues its mission to help build safer communities one story, one department at a time.',\n",

New policing strategies implemented by the RPD over the last year have contributed to a 23 percent drop in burglaries, according to Chief Bill Heim. The department, Heim said, has combined predictive policing data with its existing crime-mapping system, allowing it to shift officers\\' efforts from places that have experience crime to areas where the next crime was predicted to occur. \"With almost 100,000 residents, we need to be doing everything we can to keep Reading residents safer,\" Heim said. \"We\\'ve lost over 45 officer positions due to financial constraints but have gained this invaluable tool.\" The RPD began using predictive policing software, called PredPol, in October 2013 to help it identify where to strategically deploy officers in the places and at the times crime is most likely to occur. Using a unique algorithm, PredPol provides Reading crime analysts and officers with customized \"boxes\" on maps of the city, identifying the 500-by-500-foot areas where the highest probability exists for a crime to occur, explained Heim, adding that the boxes are automatically generated for each shift of each day. \"We\\'ve been tracking the number of times our officers patrol inside the PredPol boxes. Their presence really helps deter crime,\" Heim remarked. \"It\\'s shown itself to be a real force-multiplier in crime prevention.\" The chief noted that some of the boxes represent places that officers routinely cover, but many others are places that might not otherwise receive attention.

The article was written by the former Santa Cruz Police Crime Analyst Zach Friend and discusses the department\\'s process for implementation - including officer buy in, data collection and evaluation. Here is an excerpt: [Read the whole story here: http://1.usa.gov/17pxuvh] \"The algorithm is a culmination of anthropological and criminological behavior research. It uses complex mathematics to estimate crime and predict future hot spots. Researchers based these studies on information that officers inherently know. For example, when people are victims, the chance that they or their neighbors will be victimized again increases. Offenders criminalize familiar areas. There are detectable patterns associated with the times and locations of their crimes. Using an earthquake aftershock algorithm, the system employs verified crime data to predict future offenses in 500-square-foot locations. The program uses historical information combined with current data to determine patterns...\"',\n",
       " 'Santa Clara Newspaper Features PredPol From The Santa Clara newspaper... Putting a cop at the crime scene before it happens with a mathematical formula sounds like it came straight out of a Hollywood movie, but with new technology, it\\'s now possible. George Mohler, an assistant professor in the mathematics and computer science department at Santa Clara University, is one of the masterminds behind Predictive Policing, a new computer software. His company, PredPol, may be the next era of crime prevention. Since police departments nationwide are facing budget cuts, this new resource allows them to be more effective and responds to public demand for crime prevention without spending more money. Mohler started working with a team of researchers from the University of California Mathematical and Simulation Modeling of Crime project, funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation. The UC MaSC project has one goal: to develop a statistical model for crime. With the help of research from this group, Mohler was able to come up with a mathematical equation to predict crime based on the same formula currently used to predict aftershocks for earthquakes. After publishing papers about his theory, Zach Friend, Santa Cruz Police crime analyst, reached out to Mohler about implementing the algorithm. The predictive policing program was put to the test. \"We decided to try the predictive policing program because our department had experienced about a 20 percent decline in staffing coupled with a 30 percent increase in call-for-services,\" said Friend. Since implementing the program, there has been a decrease in Santa Cruz crime, including residential, commercial and vehicular burglaries, dropping all burglaries by 27 percent. Another experiment with Los Angles Police Department saw similar drops in crime. Mohler presented the statistical model to one of his classes at Santa Clara. One of his calculus students, Omar Qazi, approached Mohler after the discussion. \"I knew I could make his software better,\" said Qazi. Qazi and Mohler started working together to further develop the software. \"(Qazi) has ultimately made this software better, and I would work with him regardless of his age because he is a unique, talented individual,\" said Mohler. PredPol analyzes the times, dates and places of recent crimes. It updates constantly when new crimes occur and then finds patterns that forecast high-risk times and locations for future crime. The cost to implement PredPol depends on the population of the city, but it is always less than the cost of hiring an officer for a year. PredPol may violate the Fourth Amendment, however, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Professor Andrew Ferguson from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law wrote an article called \"Predictive Policing and Reasonable Suspicion,\" examining predictive policing and the possibilities of how it will impact reasonable suspicion. \"In the future, predictive policing will affect the Fourth Amendment reasonable suspicion analysis,\" said Ferguson. \"How it affects it and whether these changes weaken or strengthen Fourth Amendment protections remains unclear.\" Friend said, \"The program is not a replacement for an officer\\'s talents, intuition or experience. It is simply a tool that helps them do their job.\" The Sponsored Projects Office at the university assists in proposal, funding, developing project ideas and submitting completed project plans. Mary-Ellen Fortini, director of Sponsored Projects, reviewed the grant Mohler submitted for PredPol. \"We have to balance between the gain and the risk -- do the risks outweigh the benefits?\" said Fortini. \"In this case, predictive policing benefits outweigh the risk.\" Major cities around the United States including San Francisco, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, Los Gatos, and as far away as Kent, England are using PredPol today.

       " \"PredPol's Advanced Predictive Policing Technology Now Available to Corporate Customers: The use of big data and artificial intelligence is revolutionizing the way law enforcement operations are conducted around the world. Now, for the first time, PredPol, the leader in predictive policing, is bringing its police-tested technologies to the private sector. Corporate and private security companies have responsibilities much like law enforcement: officers have the dual responsibility of responding to incidents and proactively patrolling within their area of operation. In the case of corporate and private security, however, the emphasis is primarily on patrol and prevention. PredPol supports the patrol and operations management activities that are core to the private security function. With our patented machine learning algorithm, you can predict where and when specific events are most likely to occur. PredPol has successfully predicted everything from burglaries to medical events and even traffic collisions. Using just 3 data points - event type, event location, and event date/time - PredPol can use your historical data to train our algorithm to predict future adverse events. Since we never use any demographic or personally identifiable information, there is no potential for infringement of privacy or civil rights, a concern often voiced at the application of this technology. We can use your internal event data and supplement it with open-source crime data where available. PredPol securely delivers its patrol recommendations via a web interface to any internet-connected device: computers, smartphones, or mobile data terminals. Officers get a set of targeted areas, represented as red boxes on a Google Maps interface, to patrol during their shift. If you use GPS in your operations, PredPol can provide insight into patrol compliance, give visibility into patrol routes, and create patrol heatmaps as well. Our analytics module provides CompStat-like features that summarize event and operations data for internal management and external reporting. You can search and sort by event type, beat, shift, date and other options - all through a point-and-click menu. And since we believe that your data should always be easily accessible, we let you easily export reports as PDFs or into CSV files.

       " 'PredPol Featured on CNN Faced with declining budgets and greater demands on service police departments are looking for tools that help deploy resources more effectively. As a recent feature story on CNN noted, one major resource emerging for law enforcement is predictive policing - spearheaded by a new California-based company called PredPol. Zach Friend, a Crime Analyst with the Santa Cruz Police Department, one of the first agencies in the nation to deploy this program noted, \"we\\'re facing a situation where we have 30 percent more calls for service but 20 percent less staff than in the year 2000, and that is going to continue to be our reality. So we have to deploy our resources in a more effective way. This model does that.\" So what exactly is predictive policing? Predictive policing shifts how police resources are allocated; from the reactive to the proactive. As CNN reported, the program is called PredPol (short for predictive policing), and it calculates its forecasts based on times and locations of previous crimes, combined with sociological information about criminal behavior and patterns. The technology has been beta tested in the Santa Cruz, California police department for the past year, and in an L.A. police precinct for the past six months, with promising results. In fact, Santa Cruz Police have seen a 19 percent reduction in burglaries since implementing the program while Los Angeles Police have seen 25 percent reduction.  LAPD estimates the implementation of the program has saved over $4 million in costs to the community. More information about the company can be found at www.predpol.com',\n",
       " 'SacBee Online - PredPol Results in \"Dramatic Crime Reduction\": Cities that have implemented PredPol, a computer software program that predicts when and where crime will occur, have seen \"cliff-like\" drops in crime often within months of deployment. PredPol is a secure, cloud-based software-as-a-service, developed by a team of PhD mathematicians, criminologists, and social scientists at UCLA, Santa Clara University, and UC Irvine in close collaboration with crime analysts and line level officers at the Los Angeles and Santa Cruz Police Departments. In just six months after launch, those first two cities saw crime reductions of 12% to 25% in burglaries and auto thefts compared to the previous Since that time, targeted crimes have continued to drop in Los Angeles, Santa Cruz and in numerous other agencies that have deployed the technology. \"I\\'m convinced that predictive policing works,\" LAPD Captain Sean Malinowski told NBC Southern California. A study of crime data going back 80 months shows a \"cliff-like drop\" when predictive policing began, according to Captain Malinowski. After these successful initial deployments PredPol has deployed its groundbreaking technology in dozens of cities around the United States as well as the United Kingdom. In Alhambra, California, police are using PredPol to target three primary crime types: car theft, theft from vehicles and auto burglary. Since deployment, those crimes have gone down by 7 percent, 20 percent and 32 percent respectively. \"PredPol is an invaluable added tool that allows our police force to use their patrol time more efficiently and helps stop crime before it happens,\" Alhambra Chief Mark Yokoyama told the Global Times. \"This technology offers an excellent crime-fighting solution that will ultimately make Alhambra safer.\" PredPol\\'s core technology has grown from success with property crimes to include prediction of drug crime, gang crime, anti-social behavior, and the recently released gun violence prediction tool. Kent Police in England have watched as violent crime has dropped by 6 percent since they began using PredPol\\'s tool and now the Seattle Police Department have partnered with PredPol to predict and deter gun violence. Dr. George Mohler, PredPol co-founder and professor of mathematics and computer science atSanta Clara University noted that, \"while no single strategy can end gun violence, predictive policing gives officers a significantly better idea of when and where to be so that they can deter crime. If we can prevent just one gun crime, that will mean one less neighbor, friend, or family member who becomes a victim.\" PredPol\\'s unique crime prediction methodology leverages existing crime data that every city already has, advanced mathematics developed over more than six years, computer learning, cloud computing, and the indispensable experience of veteran police.  The crime data is analyzed through a sophisticated algorithm that applies proven criminal theories about crime - including gun violence.  The results are more accurate and more actionable recommendations for when and where crime is most likely to occur, thus allowing police to show up before crime happens. PredPol has extensively modeled this new approach to deterring gun violence, predicting a greater number of gun homicides compared with existing approaches, including traditional hotspot maps. PredPol successfully outperforms current best practices by 66 percent. This corresponds with even stronger performance that police agencies have seen with PredPol\\'s broader technology for predicting and preventing other violent crimes and property offenses.  In scientifically controlled experiments in Los Angeles and Kent, England, PredPol\\'s predictions not only reduced crime but were 100 percent more accurate than existing best practices - predicting double the number of crimes as current crime mapping and hotspot analysis. Without predictive analytics, police are forced to chase yesterday\\'s crime by relying on simple mapping of past crime data. It would be like forecasting the weather using only historical weather patterns, but ignoring weather radar.  Traditional crime mapping tools are calibrated less frequently, rely more on humans to recognize patterns, and allocate resources based on past crimes rather than predicted future offenses. PredPol does not replace the insights of veteran officers and crime analysts, but delivers an easy-to-use enhancement that lets police do more with their current resources.  ',\n",

But PredPol is a data-driven company, so we set out to see if we could measure that with one of our customers, and the results might surprise you. Our customers use PredPol to manage their patrol operations and to help keep their cities safer. We decided to use the metric of crime reduction to see if this was a worthwhile investment. The customer we looked at is a medium-sized city in the Southern United States with a population a little under 300,000. Within the first year of deployment, our customer saw some great results: So how do you turn these crime reductions into dollars and cents? There are lot of ways you can try to quantify the impact of crime reduction, but we decided to go with a simple and easily understood approach. We turned the impact of these crime reductions into savings of officer time. Looking at it another way, every hour that an officer isn't responding or investigating a crime is an hour that can be spent on proactive patrol, building community relations, and working to keep the city safe. We took these crime reduction numbers and applied some well-researched metrics against them to see how much officer time was saved. The results were pretty impressive! The savings represented by these crime reductions worked out to the equivalent of 16 full-time officers! That's 16 people that the department doesn't have to recruit, hire, train, and retain. Given the current problems that many departments are having recruiting and keeping officers, this was a big win for them. The dollar savings represented by this drop in crime was also impressive. On an annualized basis, measuring purely in officer time saved, it worked out to over $1.7 million. With an initial investment of only $60,000, that worked out to a return on investment of 2,900%. That means for every $1 they spent, they received the equivalent in $29 in additional officer time. Want to find out more about how they did this?

       " '\"Just Driving Around\" Isn\\'t a Patrol Strategy: Here at PredPol we speak with dozens of Police Departments and Sheriff\\'s Offices across the country every month. When we ask them what their patrol strategies are, we\\'re usually told that it\\'s left to their officers\\' or deputies\\' discretion. In other words, they don\\'t have a set of tactical guidelines that tells their patrol team where to patrol and what crime types to be targeting. This raises issues of effectiveness, transparency and accountability for any agency. Having a patrol strategy means proceduralizing several elements of patrol operations and implementing them across the agency on a daily, shift-by-shift basis. There are at least three elements of an effective patrol strategy. The first is using historical and current data to define crime types to be targeted. At PredPol we call these \"missions.\" The second element is finding patterns in crime data to define where and when to patrol in order to micro-target those crime types. The third element is using AVL/GPS or officer checkin/checkout data to ensure that these targeted areas are being patrolled. This allows the agency to close the loop to ensure officers are actually targeting those locations. Here\\'s how your agency can use PredPol to create an effective patrol strategy: 1. Define your agency\\'s missions. PredPol\\'s analytics tools show command staff and crime analysts your current and historical crime trends. This is presented at an aggregate level as well as by patrol area and by shift. You can see which crime types are increasing and then drill down to see where and when this is happening. This allows you to set specific missions, such as a \"Vehicle Crimes\" mission focused on the shopping district on weekdays, a \"Personal Crimes\" mission for the downtown area on weekends, and so on. How you set your missions and the crime types you choose to include is totally up to you. Our customers generally review missions on a monthly or quarterly basis. 2. Make targeted patrol recommendations. Once you have set up your missions, PredPol does all the heavy lifting. Our platform uses artificial intelligence to find patterns in historical and current crime data. From that data, we automatically identify environmentally driven crime locations (such as bus stations or the bar and restaurant district) as well as clusters of crimes associated with the behavioral patterns of specific individuals. (We do that using just crime type, crime location and crime date and time - we don\\'t use any personally identifiable or demographic information). These locations are those deemed to be highest risk for that day and shift. In other words, this is where officers are most likely to be effective while on patrol. Our targeted recommendations are presented as a series of bright red boxes on a map interface, making them simple to use and understand. 3. Monitor and manage your patrols in real time. We give command staff insight into exactly how effective their officers are at deterring crime in the areas they patrol. If you have AVL or GPS devices, PredPol can let you use that data to manage and measure patrol performance. You can ensure targeted boxes are being visited and for how long (what we call \"dosage\" at PredPol). When crime rates aren\\'t going down as expected, you can check historical dosage levels down to the shift and beat level to see how much and how often boxes are being visited. You can also create historical patrol heatmaps from the top level of your jurisdiction down to the beat level to ensure areas aren\\'t getting overpatrolled or underpatrolled. This degree of transparency into patrol operations gives agencies a more objective way to manage their officers and hold them accountable for their performance.

       " \"Newest PredPol Features Improve Insight, Save Time & Maximize Resources: From its creation, PredPol has relied on the input of patrol officers, command staff, and crime analysts to design its platform and features.  Predpol is a force-multiplying tool that augments the insights of crime analysts and patrol officers. PredPol has been deployed in over 50 law enforcement agencies of varying sizes, populations, and international locations. Our technology complements existing systems and allows more time for analysts to conduct the analysis and intelligence work for which they are trained.  We work extensively with our customers to develop and review new features. We're happy to announce some new ones here that leverage the AVL/GPS data that many of our customers provide us. Dosage: Our new dosage meter displays the amount of time an officer spends inside PredPol boxes during a shift in relation to the ideal amount of time an officer should be spending inside the boxes. Based on extensive review of real-world data from our customers, our recommendation is for officers to spend between 5 and 15% of of their patrol time in PredPol boxes. That averages out out to about 6 minutes per hour. PredPol lets you see if your officers are hitting these targets. Of course, on a busy shift, they may be too busy to get to all of their boxes. The goal is to get to that 5-15% range over time, across all officers and all shifts. Our patented dosage tracking tool lets you quickly see how you're doing against these recommended targets, and allows you to figure out where to direct more of your resources. It also allows you to see who your top performers are! You can compare doage times for each patrol officer in our new easy-to-digest dosage chart.  Missions: We've reconfigured our Missions page so that you can edit or change missions easily, giving you flexibility to assign your resources to target specific crime types as required. We now give you an overview of the entire week, allowing you to manage your missions more efficiently. GPS: Our new and improved GPS feature gives you the option to see each patrol car path in real time. It also shows you how long a patrol car has spent inside each PredPol box, all in the same view.

       " \"Using Custom PredPol Boxes for COVID-19 Patrols: It is becoming clear that COVID-19 is upending everything in our daily lives. It'schanging how we shop, socialize, go to school, and in most cases how we work. Butregardless of the changes it is wreaking in the world today, the job of the patrolofficer remains the same: keeping the community safe. Calls for service can't be answered from your home office and you can't proactively patrol a neighborhood from behind the safety of a computer screen. Patrol operations require officers to be out on the streets while the rest of us shelter in place. Even though the mission and responsibilities remain unchanged, the environment isdifferent. Patrol work has become even more dangerous. As we are now seeing inthe news, the risk of infection to officers is quite high, largely because their job is tointeract with broad segments of the public. Some departments are nowtrying to minimize officer interaction with the public as much as possible.This underscores a critical point: crime prevention is one of the most effectiveways to reduce officer risk of infection. Each crime prevented means one lessinstance of responding to a call for service, one less set of interviews with witnesses,one less exercise in evidence collection, one less round of questioning of suspects. Itmeans one less arrest, one less trial, one less person placed into custody. Each timeyou eliminate one of those steps, you greatly reduce the risk of officer exposure toCOVID-19. As mentioned in our previous blog, with shutdowns and social distancing in place,COVID-19 is causing a change in the patterns of crime types, crime locations, andcrime dates and times. Officers need to be able to anticipate these changing trendsand try to get ahead of them. Even the kinds of things officers do on patrol are starting to change. A few monthsago, few of us could have imagined that officers would be asked to keep people awayfrom parks or beaches on a sunny day, or to break up gatherings of a dozen peoplewho are just sitting around having a picnic. Activities like enforcing stay-homeorders for infected residents are also new territory for most officers. PredPol wants to help officers stay safe and effective, and fortunately we have toolsthat can do that. In particular, our custom boxes feature lets command staff addtheir own boxes anywhere they need to on a patrol map. Here are some of the ideasour partners have come up with: - Use custom boxes to designate an area deemed to be at high risk for infectionto responding officers. This could be based on a high number of potentialCovid-19 patients near that location, or other environmental factors, such asa higher number of people whose circumstances put them at risk in that area.- Use custom boxes to identify residences subject to stay-home orders. Most people gracefully accept these orders to protect their fellow citizens, but noteveryone cooperates, so rolling a cruiser through their neighborhoodperiodically can remind them of their obligations. - Use custom boxes to identify areas prone to gatherings disallowed undershelter-in-place or social-distancing rules. These can include parks, beaches, parking lots, ball fields, and other areas where problematic behavior has been observed. By identifying these locations in each patrol area, command staff can ensure that they are being adequately patrolled. These box locations can be varied by time of day and day of week based on perceived risks. Like itor not, law enforcement officers have also become de facto public healthofficers, and enforcing social-distancing requirements helps keep the wholecommunity safer.

       " 'Atlanta Magazine Highlights PredPol The Atlanta Magazine featured PredPol and a recent deployment by Norcross Police. The article, written by Josh Green, can be seen here  - or read below: It was more than intuition that drew a Norcross police officer to an extended-stay hotel. A computer program in her police cruiser had advised her to scope out that very hotel, at that very hour. When she arrived, she spotted a suspicious-looking man. Turns out, the man was on the lam, living at the hotel but wanted in Illinois on warrants stemming from burglary charges, officials said. \"He would eventually have been doing something wrong in Norcross,\" said Warren Summers, the city\\'s police chief. But the hotel resident never got the chance. His was just one of several arrests made within the first twenty-four hours after Norcross rolled out new security software on August 8. The technology is, depending on your perspective, either a super creepy form of snooping or a highly effective crime deterrent. Norcross became the first police department in Georgia to launch a real-time crime prediction tool from a company called PredPol (short for \"predictive policing\"). Using the same concepts retailers like Amazon and Target rely on to chart consumer behavior, the police program uses existing crime data (location, type of crime, dates, times, etc.) to form algorithms that lead police to where specific crimes are most likely to occur. It may sound farfetched--or like a plot device in a science-fiction thriller--but Chief Summers, for one, is sold. Norcross cops credit the program with helping officers snare several suspects the first day--including the absconder from Illinois and two alleged burglars, who Summers said were caught red-handed in a house that fell within a 500 square-foot \"predictive box\" for misdeeds identified by the PredPol algorithms. A team of mathematicians and social scientists developed PredPol at three California universities over the past six years. Since its launch in 2011, departments from Santa Cruz to Columbia, South Carolina have adopted the technology. For now, PredPol helps Norcross officers target theft-related crimes such as robbery and burglary, as opposed to homicides or domestic disputes. The department is paying for the program with seized drug money. Elsewhere in the metro area, the Atlanta Police Department started a ninety-day PredPol pilot program in July. Department spokesman Carlos Campos said APD would launch the program in the fall, if they deem the pilot a success. All thirty Norcross patrol cars have access to PredPol via onboard laptops. Officers have been trained to patrol the \"predictive boxes\" frequently. \"You may displace crime just by being there,\" Summers said. \"The ultimate goal is not only to catch people but prevent crime.\" - See more at: http://www.atlantamagazine.com/agenda/2013/08/19/norcross-police-roll-out-predpol-crime-predicting-technology#sthash.ad7ursMx.dpuf',\n",
       " 'San Diego Union-Tribune Newspaper Highlights PredPol: The San Diego Union Tribune featured Carlsbad Police\\'s deployment of PredPol in a recent article - here is an excerpt: It appears that the Carlsbad Police Department will become the first law enforcement agency in San Diego County to use crime-prediction software, a trendy new tool credited with reducing crime in Los Angeles, Memphis and other cities. Carlsbad officials said last week they recently agreed to start using PredPol software early next year in an effort to reduce crime and deploy the department\\'s 110 officers more effectively. The software is based on the idea that if police can more often be in the right place at the right time, many crimes would get solved while they happen or not take place at all... Using mathematical formulas that can help predict the locations of earthquake aftershocks, PredPol gives police officers maps showing where future crimes are likely to take place. The software combines data about past crimes with universal trends in criminal activity and other information from local police, such as where a set of streetlights has burned out. While virtually all law enforcement agencies study patterns of where and when past crimes occurred, PredPol uses algorithms -- step-by-step mathematical calculations -- to look ahead. \"They\\'re looking at crime through a rearview mirror and we\\'re looking through the front windshield\" said Ryan Coonerty, PredPol\\'s director of government relations and strategy. \"It\\'s been shown to be a little more than twice as effective.\" In the Foothill area of Los Angeles in 2012, more than 6 percent of crimes took place within areas on maps created by PredPol, while only 3 percent happened in locations mapped by Police Department analysts. That year, overall crime was down 12 percent in the Foothill area, with department officials crediting PredPol for part of the drop. Meanwhile, burglaries were down 19 percent when Santa Cruz began using the software in 2012. Coonerty said predictive policing is the next evolution in crime fighting, describing it as an advance similar to community policing in the 1960s and the CompStat system for analyzing past crime data in the 1990s. PredPol was designed by professors at UCLA, UC-Irvine and Santa Clara University. Time magazine included crime-prediction software on its list of the best inventions of 2011...',\n",
       " \"The Creation of PredPol: The Predictive Policing Company About one year after the Santa Cruz Police Department piloted a new beta predictive policing software developed by a team of mathematicians, the company PredPol was formed to meet the demand from law enforcement agencies throughout the country. Today we sat down with company CEO Caleb Baskin, a managing partner of a law firm and one of the founders of the nation's largest co-working business NextSpace Co-Working and Innovation to ask him some questions about the company. Why did you think there was a need to create a company?  Mr. Baskin: The response from agencies around the country and around the world to the research and trials in Santa Cruz and Los Angeles was tremendous.  These two agencies were inundated with hundreds of inquiries from law enforcement personnel seeking to get access to this new tool.  That demand simply could not be met within the framework of the academic experiment being conducted by Dr. Mohler and Dr. Brantingham.  Building a company, which could make this Software as a Service available to any agency that needs it, was the only responsible thing to do. Dr. Mohler and Dr. Brantingham continue to test and improve the software to ensure we are providing the most accurate, scientifically-tested product at a price that cash-strapped agencies can afford. What are the main goals of the company?   Mr. Baskin: PredPol's goal is to provide intuitive and effective tools that let law enforcement agencies predict crime in real time, before it occurs.  We are leveraging the cloud to do this at a price point that is affordable to all agencies, large or small.  Cutting edge technology and science have a crucial roll to play in public safety (and other sectors of government) and PredPol is making those tools available to agencies now. It's important that smaller cities have access to big time analytics and this program provides that. How is this different from other products on the market?  Mr. Baskin: PredPol is the only tool that tells agencies where and when crime is likely to occur, down to a micro-place location only 500 feet by 500 feet, in real time.  These aren't heat maps or other forms of data visualization.  PredPol generates specific, precise actionable intelligence that agencies can use to deploy their limited resources in the most effective manner possible. This was created and tested jointly by cops and professors. This is public service oriented. We believe in our product and know that it can reduce crime so we are enthusastic about providing it at a fair price for cities large and small.

       " 'LAPD Predicting Crime with PredPol - KQED California Report: KQED (NPR Affiliate) ran a story on PredPol and Los Angeles Police on their recent California Report show. Here is an excerpt (and full link below): In an age of big data, California police departments are getting in on the action. In Los Angeles, the LAPD now uses software for what it calls \"predictive policing\"--anticipating where crimes are likely to happen before they happen. Outside the LAPD\\'s Foothill Division station, at the northern edge of Los Angeles, police Sgt. Tom Gahry sits in his black-and-white patrol car. He\\'s shuffling through a stack of maps with bright red squares drawn on them \"These squares,\" Gahry explains, pointing to one of the printouts, \"according to the computer system, there\\'s a high probability that a crime will occur within one of those squares.\" Gahry is one of the officers using predictive policing software called PredPol. It takes crime data, runs it through an algorithm, and then generates these maps. The maps tell police where crimes might happen -- before they take place. Police can spend extra time in the areas at risk for crime, the thinking goes, and prevent those crimes from ever occurring. The LAPD says predictive policing has helped reduce crime here in the Foothill Division. This predictive policing software\\'s journey started seven years ago, at UCLA. There, academics and police officers began using math to study crime. One of the postdocs on the project, mathematician George Mohler, discovered an equation that transformed the work. Mohler, who now teaches at Santa Clara University, realized that, mathematically, earthquakes and crime work in a similar way. Mathematical models for predicting earthquake aftershocks could be applied to predict the \"after-crimes\" of an initial incident. According to Mohler\\'s model, one crime sets off a wave of crimes in an area. The equation draws in details from police reports, such as times, locations and types of crimes that already have happened. Mohler explains, \"The idea would be, after that initial report gets filed, then the model says \\'Hey! There\\'s a risk of after-crimes, or aftershocks.\\' And then the police go into that area and they prevent those second and third crimes from occurring - See more at: http://www.californiareport.org/archive/R201309061630/b#sthash.Iw0B5E7j.dpuf',\n",
       " 'Government Technology Magazine Features PredPol Deployment in Tacoma The most recent issue of Government Technology Magazine highlighted the success of PredPol\\'s predictive policing software in deployments in Tacoma, Washington and Santa Cruz, CA. The article, Predicting the Epicenter of Crime: Analytics Tool Cuts Crime Rates, explained how PredPol works and how it is being deployed in the field. Here is the article written by John Twachtman: With the right kind of data analytics, geologists can predict earthquakes. Turns out those same principles can be applied to predicting crime. That concept has been turned into an analytics tool that is now being used by more than 20 police departments in the U.S. and one in the United Kingdom.  Chief of R&D and co-founder of predictive policing company PredPol Jeffrey Brantingham explained the comparison to Government Technology. \"Look at earthquakes. You have a complex terrain that has faults all over the place. ... Big ones, small ones, and they tend to generate earthquakes at a known rate. ... And when you have those earthquakes on those faults, they produce lots of aftershocks.\" Brantingham said that crime follows a similar pattern. \"The mathematical architecture being used to study crime is closely related to what you can use to study earthquakes.\" Brantingham said that there are features in the environment that, by their nature, are prone to crime, much like faults are to earthquakes. \"A shopping mall is a great example. It\\'s a standing crop of cars to be stolen or to be broken into. It\\'s not going anywhere. It\\'s like a big fault that produces earthquakes at a regular clip.\" Crimes also tend to produce \"aftershocks,\" as criminals tend to be creatures of habit and return to the same locations where they found previous success. \"So you get these after-crimes that occur near in space and near in time to previous crimes.\" PredPol takes that information - what crime is being committed, when and where it happens - and applies mathematical algorithms, and uses it as the basis to forecast where crime will happen in the future. The concept grew out of using hot spots to track where crime is occurring (where you map crime over long intervals to see where it is concentrated to aid in the allocation of resources). But PredPol cuts down the reaction time to changes in crime patterns that might not be readily apparent by simply looking at hot spots marked on a map, thus allowing for a more real-time reaction to changes in the crime landscape. But while the tool is about predicting crime, Brantingham also pointed out that this is not a profiling tool to identify who is committing crimes. \"We\\'re actually not saying anything about who, we are saying something about where and when crime is most likely to occur regardless of who may or may not be prone to commit those crimes,\" he said. For the Santa Cruz, Calif., Police Department, statistics show an overall decline in crime in targeted areas. From 2011, when PredPol was implemented to 2012, burglaries declined 22 percent, robberies declined 27 percent, assaults were down 9 percent and arrests were up 56 percent while auto theft recovery improved by 22 percent. Available year-to-date totals through August 2013 show robberies down 4 percent and assaults down 11 percent, and though burglaries are up 7 percent for the year so far, they have seen a decrease in recent months. Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark noted that crime patterns are dynamic, but having PredPol allows for more real-time reaction to those changing patterns. He also suggested that the big drop from 2011 to 2012 accounted for the \"low-hanging fruit\" and expects the reductions to be less dramatic in years to come. Clark noted that his department was an early partner of PredPol, helping validate the predictive modeling algorithms. He approached the company after reading an article about their research, hopeful it could help in Santa Cruz, particularly as the department was facing more calls for service and a decrease in \"unobligated minutes\" when officers can patrol while not on a call. Faced with static resources, Clark said the department recognized that it needed to be more effective with its unobligated minutes to help keep communities safe and maintain quality-of-life standards. The Tacoma, Wash., Police Department also is seeing a positive impact following the start of a year-long beta test that began March 1, 2013, though no statistics are yet available. Speaking on the decision to use the tool, Assistant Chief Pete Cribbin noted that in 2005, the Tacoma Police Department began strategic planning activities, one of which was to find ways to leverage data for more effective policing. \"The police department was collecting enormous amounts of data but not effectively using [it] in crime prevention efforts,\" Cribbin said. \"The goal was to become a data-driven organization with real-time data available to all officers, investigators and command staff.\" He noted that hot spot mapping and other tools were previously employed and PredPol has become an extension of those earlier efforts. Tacoma Police Department Crime Analyst Megan Yerxa added that officers \"have the ability to look at PredPol on their smartphones and laptops in real time and make adjustments as needed. It provides a much more focused way of policing that shifts the efforts beyond responding to crime to proactively preventing it by policing the probabilities for crime.\" The department is currently using PredPol to target property crime, including residential burglary, commercial burglary, motor vehicle theft, vehicle prowls and robbery. Cribbin anecdotally noted that because of adding the PredPol analytics tool, \"we have had several successes of catching the offender \\'red-handed\\' and making arrests.\" Santa Cruz\\'s Clark also pointed to some residual benefits in changing officer habits. \"Every officer out there knows a spot on their beat where they can go right now and arrest somebody,\" Clark said. However, \"it\\'s not really addressing some of the core issues that are relating to these other crimes that we are targeting in this. ... It gives you a more purpose-based strategy as you go out there as an officer each day.\" And Clark was emphatic in stating that PredPol is a tool to enhance the work that officers do. \"This is not a substitute for your experience, your knowledge, your good old-fashioned gut sense of things,\" he said. \"This is here to help enhance that.\"',\n",

       " 'Richmond Police Use PredPol to Prevent Crime: Below is an article from the Richmond Confidential - shared by SFGate Blog: Each morning, Richmond Police Lt. Andre Hill turns on his computer and looks at where crime is most likely to occur in the city.  \"If you look here, there\\'s five red boxes in the iron triangle for the day shift,\" Hill said, while pointing at his computer screen. Each box represents a two and a half square block area where burglaries, car thefts, and robberies are most likely to take place. RPD officers in patrol spend at least 40 minutes per shift in each of the boxes. \"They park their car, get out, walk around, and engage with the community,\" Hill said. Theoretically, their presence will suppress crime before it happens. The computer system is called predictive policing. It\\'s an algorithm--similar to one used to predict aftershocks from an earthquake--that analyzes data and forecasts the likelihood of crimes occurring in certain areas. \"With this system, we can say that between 6 o\\'clock and 10 o\\'clock at night, this is where crime is most likely to occur,\" RPD Captain Mark Gagan said. \"With that information we can be much more focused.\" RPD began using the system in June. While it\\'s too soon to definitively say whether or not it has been effective, the system has been widely praised both within the department, and by other California police agencies. The Santa Cruz police department implemented the system in 2011, and since then overall crime has declined significantly--the only way to measure the system\\'s efficacy since it\\'s meant to prevent crime from occurring. However, according to police records, calls for service and arrests have increased, the latter by 56 percent. \"From a statistician\\'s point of view you wouldn\\'t expect that,\" Santa Cruz Deputy Chief Steven Clark said. With more calls for service and more arrests, logically one would expect more crime. However, the data suggests that police are increasingly in the right place at the right time. \"It seems like the program\\'s working, especially when you look at the surrounding communities that are dealing with increases in crime,\" Clark said. The LAPD began using predictive policing in 2012, and results have been positive. In Richmond, vehicle theft is down 23 percent and burglaries are down 10 percent since this time last year, according to police records. The department hopes the system will help ease a recent spike in robberies, which have increased by 24 percent since last year. However, Captain Gagan said the system isn\\'t a panacea. \"Nothing is ever going to replace an officer\\'s ability to listen to people, talk to people, and connect to people,\" he said. The department is debating whether predictive policing maps would be more useful if they were publicly available, allowing residents to see where they\\'re most likely to become a victim of crime.  \"Having community looking out for each other and knowing what\\'s going on in the neighborhood is much more powerful than having police officers at the right place at the right time,\" Gagan said. However, because the technology is still new to the department, it has yet to decide what to do about making maps available to the public.  ',\n",
       " 'Alhambra Police Laud PredPol Successes: From the Pasadena Star News - February 11, 2014 By Zen Vuong ALHAMBRA >> A year after the Police Department implemented predictive policing software, car burglaries and vehicle thefts have decreased, Chief Mark Yokoyama said. In January 2013, Alhambra was the first law-enforcement agency in Southern California to have citywide implementation of PredPol, a cloud-based software that forecasts areas where crimes are likely to be committed. Nine months ago, some residents expressed reservations about technology that could target the homeless or minorities, but co-founder Jeffrey Brantingham, a UCLA anthropology professor, said PredPol doesn\\'t use personal information to predict crime. \"It doesn\\'t include who the offenders are or what type of music they like or anything like that,\" he said. \"It\\'s focusing on where the crimes are happening. The public calls the police and report crime. Police are using data they are given. They\\'re actually doing what the public wants. It\\'s nothing like \\'Minority Report\\' or criminal profiling.\" PredPol uses five years\\' worth of law-breaking data to map a 500-by-500-square-foot area where crime will likely happen. The technology essentially places officers at the right place and time to prevent lawbreaking. The Alhambra Police Department focused on the two most common crimes in Alhambra, Yokoyama said. By year\\'s end, when compared to 2012 numbers, car burglaries decreased by 21 percent, and auto theft declined by 8 percent, a statistics report showed. Yokoyama said the system works. He recalled a time when police officers were patrolling Valley Boulevard at PredPol\\'s direction and noticed a suspicious vehicle. They found ski masks inside the vehicles and arrested the individuals on suspicion of robbery, he said. \"The act of robbery, burglary, et cetera does not have to be committed for a crime to occur,\" Yokoyama said. \"The planning and actions toward committing the crime is a crime in and of itself. In fact, it would always be our preference to stop a crime at this stage than for an act to occur.\" Yokoyama added that giving officers direct, clear missions to patrol particular areas has had a positive effect that residents and business owners have noticed. \"It\\'s actually increased our communication and visibility to the community because (police officers are) spending more time in the residential area, as an example,\" Yokoyama said. \"I get (positive) calls all the time about why the police are in their neighborhood more.\" Residents such as William Rising, however, said he hasn\\'t noticed more officers on the streets. But he said response time to emergency calls has improved. \"Just a more visible police presence can avert many potential criminal activities, such as car theft, break-ins and drug dealing,\" he said in a Facebook post. In addition to printouts of potential crime areas, Yokoyama said every police car is now equipped with in-car computers that receive refreshed information every five minutes. In general, he said, officers spend about 35 percent of their time doing random patrols based on their knowledge of the city, and they spend 5 percent of their time focused in the 500-by-500-square-foot areas to which PredPol directs them. Yet the crime rate for certain activities has increased. Residential burglaries went up by 17 percent and robberies increased by 22 percent, a report found. \"Although the numbers are up, based on PredPol predictions, we feel a number of crimes were prevented and would have been higher if not for PredPol missions,\" Yokoyama said.',\n",
       " 'Predictive Policing Technology Dramatically Reducing Crime in Large & Small Communities Across U.S. & Overseas: PredPol\\'s Technology Helping Law Enforcement Prevent Crime Before it Occurs: Santa Cruz, California -- Communities across the United States and overseas are experiencing dramatic reductions in crime -- thanks in large part to PredPol, predictive policing technology that is helping law enforcement prevent crime before it occurs. \"Most importantly, double digit reductions in crime ensure that fewer people become victims,\" said PredPol CEO Larry Samuels, \"and they also result in more efficient deployment of finite policing resources and tremendous cost savings to our communities.\" PredPol predicts where and when a crime is most likely to occur, not who is likely to commit a crime. Because no personal data, information about individuals or demographics are utilized in making these predictions, PredPol\\'s law enforcement technology does not pose any personal privacy or profiling concerns. Jurisdictions large and small have seen dramatic reductions in crime since deploying PredPol.: For example: PredPol supports officers and analysts in predicting crimes that include property crimes, drug incidents, gang activity, gun violence, and even traffic accidents. A unique algorithm analyzes only three simple data points: place, time and date of past crimes. The patterns inherent in the crimes themselves provide ample information to predict which places and windows of time are at highest risk for future crimes. PredPol provides law enforcement agencies with affordable, customized crime predictions for localized areas - 500 feet by 500 feet boxes on maps. Once police and analysts make decisions about which crimes and missions are priorities, maps are automatically generated for each shift of a particular day. Typically, patrol officers spend a few minutes in PredPol boxes to strengthen community ties and deter crime when they\\'re not responding to calls for service or performing other duties. Some of these boxes are in places that officers routinely cover, but many PredPol prediction boxes are in places that might not otherwise receive attention.',\n",

       " 'Defining Predictive Policing Predictive policing has become a widely discussed phrase in the last few years, sometimes being used so broadly and for so many technologies that the real performance features and technical specifications get lost. This post seeks to succinctly establish parameters for a current definition of what predictive policing is. Predictive policing has become a widely discussed phrase in the last few years, sometimes being used so broadly and for so many technologies that the real performance features and technical specifications get lost. This post seeks to succinctly establish parameters for a current definition of what predictive policing is.  Predictive policing tries to harness the power of information, geospatial technologies and evidence-based intervention models to reduce crime and improve public safety. This two-pronged approach -- applying advanced analytics to various data sets, in conjunction with intervention models -- can move law enforcement from reacting to crimes into the realm of predicting what and where something is likely to happen and deploying resources accordingly. The National Institute of Justice, the research, development and evaluation agency of the United States Department of Justice, notes that law enforcement work is frequently reactive: officers respond to calls for service, quell disturbances and make arrests. In contrast, notes the NIJ, proactive policing uses data, geospatial models, and intervention models to predict what and where [and when] something is likely to happen and to deploy resources accordingly. Very importantly, the NIJ explains, \"The predictive policing approach does not replace traditional policing. Instead, it enhances existing approaches such as problem-oriented policing, community policing, intelligence-led policing and hot spot policing.\" While crime may afflict the same neighborhoods year after year, the day-to-day fluctuations in where and when crimes occur are large. Extensive research has shown that day-to-day crime patterns are the result of: Each of these processes is well known empirically, but when put together, their impact on how crime hotspots emerge, spread, and disappear is incredibly complex. This makes predictions for where crime will occur in the next 10-12 hours very difficult. The application of analytical techniques, particularly quantitative techniques, to identify promising targets for police intervention with the goal of reducing crime risk by preventing future crimes or solving past crimes. (source) Developments in mathematical and statistical modeling, high-performance cloud computing, and GPS-enabled mobile devices now make it possible for frequently updated crime forecasts to be at the disposal of officers in the field. Knowledge, skills, and experience are essential and indispensable. They can reliably direct officers to the top two or three riskiest locations in their operational environment for any particular shift on any particular day. It is much harder and time-consuming, though, for law enforcement to identify and choose between a few dozen locations where risk might be lower and is highly variable from day to day. Opportunities to disrupt crime in these places are missed and thus crime prevention and reduction becomes unnecessarily difficult. Chronic hotspots are long term in duration and necessitate problem-oriented policing strategies to address the root causes of crime. Temporary hotspots, on the other hand, last on the time scale of days to weeks. Using high-powered mathematics and near real time crime data housed in a department\\'s RMS, yesterday\\'s crime can be evaluated in the context of all crimes occurring over a long horizon and wide spatial fields to calculate accurate probabilities for where and when crime will occur today. Within these parameters, predictive policing can help law enforcement agencies intelligently inform patrol officers of where and when crime may occur, allowing them to effectively prevent crime. A minimal amount of data is needed to go beyond traditional \"hotspot\" mapping and define predictive policing.',\n",

       " 'Alhambra Police\\'s Success with PredPol Featured in International Newspaper Alhambra, California Police Department\\'s usage of PredPol (and the success with the program) was highlighted in the international publication Global Times.  Here is the story: -- A medium-sized city in southern California has successfully reduced the crime rates during the first six months of this year thanks to the adoption of a sophisticated technology, local officials said Monday. Alhambra, an independent city with a population of more than 80, 000, was the first in southern California to utilize Predictive Policing (PredPol), a cutting-edge technology across its police department, a move which has bore positive results, according to city police chief Mark Yokoyama. \"PredPol does not replace the experience and intuition of our great officers, but is rather an invaluable added tool that allows our police force to use their patrol time more efficiently and helps stop crime before it happens,\" he said at a briefing with local Chinese-language media. \"This technology offers an excellent crime-fighting solution that will ultimately make Alhambra safer.\" The city, situated in the western San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County which has faced with a trend in rising crime, has seen the rate of residential burglary and other major crimes significantly dropped six months after it launched the project in January, 2013, aiming at adding the technology to the police arsenal of crime fighting strategies in an effort to be proactive in addressing crime issues. Armed with the advanced technology which predicts or forecasts future crimes, an Alhambra officer can patrol an identified area for car burglaries and find a car burglary in progress, which led to an immediate arrest, authorities said. The police department can also find crimes occurring in the identified areas as had been forecasted, thereby validating the predictions and have also made associated arrests for other crimes while in the forecasted areas, Yokoyama said. Three most common crimes including car theft, theft from vehicles and auto burglary have gone down by 7 percent, 20 percent and 32 percent, respectively, according to Yokoyama. Residential burglary also dropped by 2 percent from late last year, he said. \"PredPol technology gives officers the best chance to be in the right place, at the right time, to stop crime before it occurs while at the same time helping to reduce crime, cut costs, and increase accuracy when officers patrol their beats,\" the veteran police officer said. PredPol, a software program which was developed over a period of six years by police officers, mathematicians, criminologists and anthropologists, based itself on previous crime reports including the time and location of a crime, and drew upon from sociological studies of criminal behavior including the insight that burglars often ply the same area. The software program looks at burglaries and car thefts and other crimes in a similar manner as predicting aftershocks from an earthquake, Yokoyama said. Alhambra has registered some 430 cases during the latter half of 2012, according to statistics provided by the police.',\n",

       " 'Happy Birthday to PredPol!: Post Updated on January 14th, 2020 This month PredPol is celebrating its eighth year as a company. However, its origins stretch back much farther than our incorporation in 2012. It is worthwhile quickly recounting that history to see both the foundations upon which the company was built and how far the company has come in practice. This history sets the stage for our future.  Today, PredPol is a full-fledged patrol operations management tool, including patrol recommendations, mission definition, officer management, and crime analytics. But our foundation is still based on place-based predictive policing, which means we use historical crime data to forecast the future risk of crime at certain places and times.  PredPol is based on theories of environmental criminology that emerged in the early 1970s. Environmental criminology was unique in that it sought to explain the processes that generate crime events, rather than the processes that generate criminal offenders. Environmental criminology thus suggested an alternative to complex and costly interventions that seek to \"fix\" people, developing practical approaches that prevent where and when crimes occur regardless of who the offenders might be. This continues to be the underlying philosophy that defines our company and differentiates us from other predictive policing methods. In 2006, a group of criminologists and mathematicians at the University of California teamed up with the Los Angeles Police Department to see if they could use historical crime data to understand how and why crime hotspots appear, spread and disappear. In 2009, the UCLA team tried using a different type of mathematics commonly applied in the analysis of earthquake aftershocks, but here used to study clusters of crimes. This proved to be very good at not only describing crime patterns in great detail, but also to provide a means to forecast where and when future crimes would occur. This research might have remained a strictly academic debate - if it were not for specific comments made in peer reviews of the resulting paper. One of the referees of the paper wrote: \"An algorithm will never beat an expert human in the field in real-time crime forecasting.\" Whether this was intended to spur action or not, that one comment changed the course of research and ultimately led to the founding of PredPol.  In November 2011, UCLA and LAPD launched a series of randomized controlled experiments of predictive policing that pitted algorithmic crime forecasting against expert crime analysts. The experiment ran for twenty-one months and showed not only were these algorithmic crime forecasting methods able to predict crime twice as accurately, but also that twice as much crime could be prevented when police used those algorithmic predictions to help direct patrol. It appeared that algorithmic methods could indeed beat expert humans in the field! The results of the predictive policing experiments in Los Angeles were exciting. Word spread quickly among the law enforcement community. Soon other agencies began asking how they could gain access to the tool. However, the team knew that something that is \"good enough\" to answer a scientific question is not sufficient for real-world operational conditions. The decision to found PredPol was in large part an admission that software designed by scientists for scientific purposes would never cut it. Especially in a critical domain like policing, a tool needs to be both available and reliable whenever it is called upon. Our mantra became \"zero friction prediction,\" meaning that PredPol wanted to make it exceptionally easy for police to get to the places that need attention and engage the problem. Following a second successful trial of the algorithm by the Santa Cruz, California Police Department, the company was established in Santa Cruz in 2012. Our highly accurate, easy-to-use predictions remain our frontline feature. However, PredPol has continued to evolve into a patrol operations management platform used by individuals at all levels of police organizations. A list of features gives a sense of what is now routine practice for many police forces using PredPol:  Going forward, we have more exciting features in store.

Here is the link. Copy below: New computer software is helping Norcross police officers patrol the city in a new way, based on historical crime reports, time of day and weather patterns. The software is called Predictive Policing, known simply as Pred-Pol. \"It\\'s predicting the highest probable location so that we can better allocate where our resources are being deployed to,\" said Lt. Bill Grogan of the Norcross Police Department. They paid $6,000 to have the software tailored to their department. The program was developed by a group of professors at UCLA and takes into account the most recent 18 months of local police data, helping officers identify certain areas that are more at risk on some days than others. Some of the areas are known for high crime rates. Others, said Grogan, come as a surprise to officers who normally would not think to spend extra time there looking for criminal activity. \"These areas you may not have thought of,\" said Grogan, referencing a map with small red squares on it, highlighting potentially problematic spots. \"Specifically, the success we had the first day it was implemented was exactly one of those locations, where the officers would not have been there. No doubt about it, their words, they would not have been there had it not been for this prediction.\" On that first day of using Pred-Pol, Aug. 9, Grogan said one of his patrol units was already in one the neighborhoods that had been denoted by a red box. There, they were able to apprehend a suspect while he was in the midst of committing burglary, according to Grogan. \"I was baffled,\" he said. \"I could not have ever anticipated that we would have had such a quick success. And not only that one success, but two in the same day.\" Grogan said his officers will likely only spend a few extra minutes per day in the areas that are marked by the red boxes, which denote areas that are roughly 500 square feet in size.',\n",

       " 'UCLA Study on Predictive Policing: UCLA anthropology professor and senior author of the study, Jeffery Brantingham, explains that the study proves that analyst\\'s use of predictive policing \"prevented twice as much crime,\" as analysts working without. Dr. Jeffery Brantingham The paper, published by Journal of American Statistical Association, details the 21-month long experiment of the mathematical model, or algorithm, that was used to predict where crimes will occur in Los Angeles, CA, and Kent, UK. The algorithm was developed with over a decade of police crime data, and 6 years worth of mathematical research. In 2011, Brantingham and his colleagues began testing in Los Angeles Police Department\\'s Southwest division, and two of Kent\\'s districts. The crime types predicted for in Los Angeles were burglary, auto theft, and auto burglary, while Kent tested the aforementioned crimes in addition to violent crimes such as robbery or assault. To test the efficacy of the algorithm, both crime analysts and the algorithm were tasked with predicting where a crime was likely to occur within a 12-hour window, and a 500 foot by 500 foot area. The algorithm was able to predict 4.7% of crime in Los Angeles, verses 2.1% of crime predicted by the analysts without the use of the algorithm. In Kent, the model was able to predict 9.8% and 6.8% while the crime analysts predicted 6.8 and 4% without using the algorithm. The next segment of the study focused on patrolling the prediction areas in 3 of Los Angeles Police Department\\'s divisions (Foothill, North Hollywood, and Southwest). The officers were to patrol 20 prediction boxes (500\\'x500\\') that were assigned by either the crime analyst of the algorithm. Neither the command staff, nor the patrol officers knew which party supplied their prediction boxes. Red 500\\' x 500\\' prediction boxes After 4 to 8 months, the study revealed that the areas assigned by the algorithm, and patrolled by the officers, had 4.3 fewer crimes than the police had expected (a reduction of 7.4%), while the analyst without the predictive model predicted 2 crimes a week. The researchers calculated, using this predictive algorithm, that the LAPD would save $9 million dollars a year. The results in crime reduction led to not only the adoption of the algorithm by both the LAPD and Kent Police, but the creation of PredPol, The Predictive Policing Company, which is available to police departments nationwide and abroad. PredPol is deployed in over 50 police departments including Atlanta, GA, and Modesto, CA, and continues to produce staggering crime reductions when combined with the knowledge of veteran officers and crime analysts.

       " 'Atlanta Police Chief George Turner Highlights PredPol Usage In the latest issue of Police Chief Magazine, Atlanta Police Chief George Turner co-authored an article about his department\\'s innovative use of PredPol - and how predictive policing has reduced crime in Atlanta. The story is below - for the complete link click here. We pride ourselves on being a department that is not satisfied with the status quo. We are forward-looking, with a strategic view grounded in innovation. We know the PredPol technology has helped us get smarter on our fight against crime. olicing crime patterns is hard business. Atlanta, Georgia, is no different than any other jurisdiction in this regard. Every day sees new crimes added to the database; and every day, the Atlanta police seek to use these data to not only respond to victims, but also to try to get out ahead of emerging hotspots and prevent crime in the first place. Until recently, the Atlanta Police Department (APD) followed a system for daily mission planning that combined hotspot mapping with the selective use of street-level intelligence. Beginning in July of 2013 for 90 days, the APD added predictive policing to the mix in two policing zones, targeting burglary, car theft, and robbery. Aggregate crime declined by 8 percent and 9 percent in the two zones compared to the prior 90-day period, with burglary and car thefts falling 10 to 28 percent. Aggregate crimes in the zones that did not deploy predictive policing increased from 1 to 8 percent. On the basis of these results, the APD decided to deploy predictive policing, as developed by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and provided by PredPol, across the city.1 The decision, though, was based on more than observed declines in crime; it was based also on a review of the science behind predictive policing and, equally important, the seamless way in which predictive policing fits within the department\\'s day-to-day operations. The Science behind Predictive Policing If one can accurately predict where and when crime will occur today, then law enforcement personnel can disrupt those crimes before they happen. But predicting where and when crime will occur is no simple task. While crime may concentrate in some of the same neighborhoods year after year, the daily variation in where and when crimes occur is often large. A neighborhood may experience multiple burglaries over the course of a year, but only one or two houses in that neighborhood may be at risk today, while tomorrow it might be two different houses on the other side of the same neighborhood. It is very difficult to predict where crime will occur in the next 10-12 hours simply based on where it occurred recently. Extensive research has shown that short-term crime patterns are driven by interactions among (1) crime generators that are built-in features of the environment; (2) repeat and near-repeat victimization that leads previous victims and their neighbors to be at greater risk of follow-on crimes; (3) the routine activity patterns of offenders and victims that keeps risk local; and (4) substantial random noise. Each of these processes is well-known empirically, but when put together, their relationship to the emergence, spread, and disappearance of crime hotspots over time is incredibly complex. Using real-time data piped in from Atlanta\\'s records management system, PredPol\\'s methodology uses high-powered mathematics to calculate probabilities of where and when crime will occur today. The mathematics are closely related to those used to study earthquakes. Any one crime can be linked to crime generators in the environment or recent nearby crime events in the same way that an earthquake can be classified as a main shock tied to a fault in the earth or an aftershock occurring closely on the heels of a previous quake. What matters most is that the mathematics allow police to not only characterize past crime, but also use past crime to forecast with great accuracy the locations where crime will occur in the immediate future. The mathematics also allows Atlanta police to forecast crime at a very fine scale while constantly adapting to crime patterns as they change from day to day. PredPol predictions identify 500 x 500 foot boxes that are at the greatest risk of crime in the coming shift. This is about the same area as four American football fields arranged side by side. The value of identifying such a small area is that police can zero in on a location with the greatest risk of crime today and distinguish it from nearby areas that are at significantly lower risk. Further, a location that is at low risk of crime today may be at high risk tomorrow, so patrol units see different boxes on different days depending on each area\\'s risk level for that specific day. Predictive Accuracy in Atlanta How accurate is predictive policing? To answer this question, one first needs to count how many crimes actually occurred in active prediction boxes. The second step is to take into account the percentage of the total policing area represented by active predictions. The value of predictive policing is maximized by predicting as much crime as possible in as small of an area as possible. Atlanta deployed predictive policing in July 2013 in two urban policing zones. Zone 4 is located to the southwest of downtown Atlanta and is characterized by mostly residential and some business areas. Zone 6 is located to the east of downtown and has retail, residential, and many restaurant areas. Both zones record some of the highest volume of Part 1 crimes in the city. The focus in Zone 4 was on burglary and robbery during the day shift, vehicle crime and robbery during the evening shift, and vehicle crime during the morning shift. The focus in Zone 6 was on burglary and vehicle crime during the day and evening shift, and all Part 1 crimes in the morning (reduced to only robbery after 45 days). The total land area of Zone 4 is 31 square miles and Zone 6 is 15 square miles. In total, 21 and 18 hotspots were predicted for each shift in Zone 4 and 6 respectively. In Atlanta, crime over the initial 90-day deployment was 24 times more likely to occur inside an active PredPol prediction box than elsewhere in the environment. This was measured by tabulating the number of crimes that occurred within each box and creating a Predictive Accuracy Index (PAI) score. The PAI is the percentage of crimes accurately predicted, normalized by the percent of the geographic area covered by the predictions. A PAI value of 1 corresponds to random chance, so a useful prediction must at least have a higher value than 1. Over the deployment period, the PAI value for Zone 4 was 23.7, and the Zone 6 PAI was 24.0. Before and After Predictive Policing in Atlanta Crime rates across all six Atlanta policing zones for the 90-day period prior to deployment in the summer of 2013 were compared with the 90-day period following deployment. As already noted, for Part 1 crimes in total, Zones 4 and 6 (the zones with predictive policing) experienced crime rate reductions of 9 percent and 8 percent, respectively. In all four of the zones where PredPol was not deployed, crime rates increased from 1 percent to 8 percent. In Zones 4 and 6, burglary rates dropped by 21 percent and 10 percent and auto theft rates dropped by 15 percent and 28 percent. Higher variance was observed in robbery rate changes due to the lower volume of robbery compared to property crime and the corresponding lower weight assigned to robbery in PredPol predictions. Robbery dropped by 34 percent in Zone 6, but increased by 31 percent in Zone 4. Using Predictive Policing in the Field There are no constraints on how a police department can use predictions to deter and prevent crime. They can be distributed to specialized units such as auto theft or robbery details, or they can be used by patrol officers as part of their daily routines. In Atlanta, missions were distributed at the start of each watch to patrol officers who were given the directive to police prediction boxes during their available time. Importantly, predictive policing does not replace the knowledge, skills, or experience of an analyst or patrol officer. Predictive policing provides information on where and when crime is most likely to occur, but it does not say how or why crimes are committed or who is potentially responsible. Patrol officers operate in ways they already know, while analysts spend less valuable time on mapmaking and more time working on the challenging problems that require their expert skills. Predictions also provide timely information about the distribution of risk that works seamlessly with analyst-developed criminal intelligence and department-driven community policing. The compelling results from the initial deployment in Zones 4 and 6 in Atlanta led to a city-wide rollout of predictive policing in November 2013. By and large, this move to make predictive policing a part of every officer\\'s daily routine has been favorably received by the front line. Leadership Matters Not surprisingly, any change in policing comes with challenges. Predictive policing is easy to use, is accurate, and impacts crime, but it requires a commitment on the part of command staff, supervisors, and patrol officers to put it to good use. Atlanta prides itself on being a department that is not satisfied with the status quo. It is forward-looking, with a strategic view grounded in innovation. Atlanta police officers know the PredPol technology has helped them get smarter in their fight against crime. The launch of predictive policing in Atlanta resulted from the partnership between the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) and the APD. The Atlanta Police Foundation is a non profit, public/private partnership focused on advancing public safety in Atlanta. In partnership with the City of Atlanta, the APD, and the business community, the APF provides research on policing best practices, strategic direction, and resources to help the APD incubate innovation, keep pace with technology, and meet strategic time-sensitive needs that help drive down crime and make Atlanta a safer city. The APF funded the initial three years of the project and are currently evaluating the results in the Technology Innovation Center where interns and professors from local universities are using quantitative methods to ensure the success and best deployment of the system. \"Predictive policing and the Technology Innovation Center have become banner programs for the Atlanta Police Foundation and have aided in significant crime reduction and prevention in Atlanta over the past year,\" said Dave Wilkinson, president and CEO of the APF. \"We are helping to position the Atlanta Police Department as a national leader in cutting edge, technology-based policing solutions. We recently published our annual crime report, which showed that crime in Atlanta between 2002 and 2012 decreased at nearly double the national rate--a true testament to the success of the partnership between the APF, the APD, and Atlanta\\'s business community.\"2?',\n",
       " '5 Common Myths about Predictive Policing While the term \"predictive policing\" has been in use for years, the growth of our software and reliance upon it has given us insight into common myths regarding its definition. This post examines 5 myths about predictive policing, discovered through recurring questions that relate to predictive policing using PredPol\\'s technology. Much of modern law enforcement strategy and technology is based on the CompStat process, which enforces principles of tracking and rapidly responding to crime in an organized manner. Predictive policing is not simply faster reactive policing where patrol officers responding to a crime receive information in the field from many different sources very quickly. Although predictive policing owes its roots to the CompStat process, its goal is to prevent crimes from happening, not responding to them faster. Predictive policing is more than traditional hotspot mapping that simply maps past crimes to make judgments about future crimes. While hotspots and heatmaps are a minimally acceptable way to allocate limited police resources, it is only half as accurate as actual forecasting technology that includes high level mathematics, machine learning, and proven theories of crime behavior. In fact, a 6 month randomized controlled trial found that crime analysts using PredPol technology in addition to their existing tools are twice as effective as experienced crime analysts using hotspot mapping alone. Predictive policing does predict that a crime will happen in the microplace prediction areas, but provides the locations that are at highest risk of a crime occurring during the prescribed window of time. The presence of police officers in the prediction areas creates a deterrence and suppression effect, thus preventing crime in the first place. Because PredPol does not collect, upload, analyze or in any way involve any information about individuals or populations and their characteristics - PredPol\\'s software technology does not pose any personal privacy or profiling concerns.  The algorithm uses advanced mathematics and computer learning to generate predictions using only three pieces of data - type, place, and time - of past crimes. Patterns inherent in the crimes themselves provide ample information on where and when crimes are likely to occur in the future. For example, if one house on a block is burglarized, there is a higher likelihood that other houses in the neighborhood will also be at risk for burglary. Law enforcement often assumes that this cutting edge technology is very expensive, requires new hiring, and means big hardware costs.  None of this is needed. PredPol can be set up to work with a Department\\'s own technology within weeks and generates actionable predictions for each shift in one tap or click. PredPol information can be printed or accessed securely through computers or mobile devices in patrol cars and in the field. The annual subscription cost is straightforward, based on population served rather than amount of crime or number of users. Law enforcement agencies using PredPol have no new hardware to buy, no new hires to make, and no limit on the number of law enforcement users or  updates.

       " 'PredPol Launches First-Of-Its-Kind Technology to Predict Gun Violence: PredPol, the Predictive Policing Company, has developed and is deploying first-of-its-kind technology to help police predict and deter gun violence.  \"We are pleased to be working with innovative leaders in our partner cities,\" said Dr. George Mohler, PredPol co-founder and professor of mathematics and computer science at Santa Clara University.  \"While no single strategy can end gun violence, predictive policing gives officers a significantly better idea of when and where to be so that they can deter crime generally, and gun violence in particular.  If we can prevent just one gun crime, that will mean one less neighbor, friend, or family member who becomes a victim.\" PredPol\\'s unique gun violence prediction methodology leverages existing crime data that every city already has, advanced mathematics developed over more than six years, computer learning, cloud computing, and the indispensable experience of veteran police.  The crime data is analyzed through a sophisticated algorithm that applies proven criminal theories about crime in general and gun violence in particular.  The results are more accurate and more actionable recommendations for when and where gun violence is most likely to occur, thus allowing police to show up before  crime happens. PredPol has extensively modeled this new approach to deterring gun violence, predicting a greater number of gun homicides compared with existing approaches, including traditional hotspot maps. PredPol successfully outperforms current best practices by 66%. This corresponds with even stronger performance that police agencies have seen with PredPol\\'s broader technology for predicting and preventing other violent crimes and property offenses.  In deployments to patrol officers in cities like Los Angeles and Kent, England, PredPol\\'s predictions not only reduced crime but were 100% more  accurate than existing best practices - predicting double the number of crimes as current crime mapping and hotspot analysis. PredPol has already deployed its broad crime prediction tool for less violent crimes and for property offenses in cities like Los Angeles and Santa Cruz in California, South Carolina\\'s capital city of Columbia, Seattle and Tacoma in Washington, and in Kent, England.  The gun violence prediction technology is part of this broader predictive policing technology package. \"We understand the challenges faced by city leaders and law enforcement and created this technology with police to help them do more with less,\" said Dr. Jeff Brantingham, co-founder of PredPol and a criminology expert at UCLA. \"Affordable, easy to use technologies allow police who have tight budgets and limited hiring ability to better direct the patrol resources they have.\"',\n",
       " 'Happy Birthday to PredPol - 7yrs. Strong: PredPol is celebrating its seventh year as a company today, January 4th. However, its origins stretch back much farther than our incorporation in 2012. It is worthwhile quickly recounting that history to see both the foundations upon which the company was built and how far the company has come in practice. This history sets the stage for our future.  Today, PredPol is a full-fledged patrol operations management tool, including patrol recommendations, mission definition, officer management, and crime analytics. But our foundation is still based on place-based predictive policing, which means we use historical crime data to forecast the future risk of crime at certain places and times.  PredPol is based on theories of environmental criminology that emerged in the early 1970s. Environmental criminology was unique in that it sought to explain the processes that generate crime events, rather than the processes that generate criminal offenders. Environmental criminology thus suggested an alternative to complex and costly interventions that seek to \"fix\" people, developing practical approaches that prevent where and when crimes occur regardless of who the offenders might be. This continues to be the underlying philosophy that defines our company and differentiates us from other predictive policing methods. In 2006, a group of criminologists and mathematicians at the University of California teamed up with the Los Angeles Police Department to see if they could use historical crime data to understand how and why crime hotspots appear, spread and disappear. In 2009, the UCLA team tried using a different type of mathematics commonly applied in the analysis of earthquake aftershocks, but here used to study clusters of crimes. This proved to be very good at not only describing crime patterns in great detail, but also to provide a means to forecast where and when future crimes would occur. This research might have remained a strictly academic debate - if it were not for specific comments made in peer reviews of the resulting paper. One of the referees of the paper wrote: \"An algorithm will never beat an expert human in the field in real-time crime forecasting.\" Whether this was intended to spur action or not, that one comment changed the course of research and ultimately led to the founding of PredPol.  In November 2011, UCLA and LAPD launched a series of randomized controlled experiments of predictive policing that pitted algorithmic crime forecasting against expert crime analysts. The experiment ran for twenty-one months and showed not only were these algorithmic crime forecasting methods able to predict crime twice as accurately, but also that twice as much crime could be prevented when police used those algorithmic predictions to help direct patrol. It appeared that algorithmic methods could indeed beat expert humans in the field! The results of the predictive policing experiments in Los Angeles were exciting. Word spread quickly among the law enforcement community. Soon other agencies began asking how they could gain access to the tool. However, the team knew that something that is \"good enough\" to answer a scientific question is not sufficient for real-world operational conditions. The decision to found PredPol was in large part an admission that software designed by scientists for scientific purposes would never cut it. Especially in a critical domain like policing, a tool needs to be both available and reliable whenever it is called upon. Our mantra became \"zero friction prediction,\" meaning that PredPol wanted to make it exceptionally easy for police to get to the places that need attention and engage the problem. Following a second successful trial of the algorithm by the Santa Cruz, California Police Department, the company was established in Santa Cruz in 2012. Our highly accurate, easy-to-use predictions remain our frontline feature. However, PredPol has continued to evolve into a patrol operations management platform used by individuals at all levels of police organizations. A list of features gives a sense of what is now routine practice for many police forces using PredPol:  Going forward, we have more exciting features in store. In 2019, we are adding demand-management features that will allow agencies to match their staffing plans with anticipated calls for service. We\\'re using machine learning to help shorten officer response times. Of course, we\\'re always looking at new ways to improve our prediction capabilities, while at the same time helping ensure the privacy and civil rights of the citizens our partner agencies protect.

       " 'Where does Data Intersect with Law Enforcement?: Big data and analytics are impacting industries across the board from telecom to health care. Insurance companies are using data not only to reduce fraud but also to provide faster analysis for claims and targeted programs for their members. Advertising has morphed into a networking relationship, using data collected from social media to partner brands with celebrities and athletes who use their own personal platforms for mutually beneficial partnerships. One study published by Forbes reported that 84% of companies see big data analytics changing their industries\\' competitive landscape and another 89% believe not adopting a big data analytics strategy would result in losing market share and momentum. Clearly, data analysis isn\\'t reserved for just tech companies and IT teams any longer. So if data is moving and changing nearly every professional and personal landscape, where does law enforcement fit into this movement? Data (Missing) in Police Work: In general, law enforcement has been slower to adopt new developments using big data. And since the stakes are higher than just a few points of market share, it is with good reason there is a hesitation to implement the latest data use on the market without careful consideration. One early criticism of data use in law enforcement is the integrity of data being collected. In some scenarios, data sourced for law enforcement software is mined from a CAD (Computer-aided Dispatch) or 9-1-1 calls. But these systems are designed to record every call that comes in- regardless if those calls are later verified as any sort of criminal activity or simply a false alarm from an overly cautious citizen. It would appear the old computer science adage \"garbage in, garbage out\" applies in the public sector as well. If the data being mined is skewed with invalid or incomplete information, any analysis of that data is going to be compromised as well. A bigger hurdle for law enforcement is the public perception of data being used to target people, race, or demographics. Thanks to science fiction movies and dystopian plots, the idea of law enforcement using data to further their police work often gets misconstrued into a version that plays well on TV but has little truth to it. Unfortunately, this has only contributed to the strain placed on relationships between law enforcement and our communities in recent years. Identifying solutions that support efforts like community policing without using unnecessary data like personal information is crucial to improving law enforcement transparency and strengthening community relations. The uncertainty in adopting data use is compounded by the pressure of understaffed departments with limited resources. One of the emerging trends facing agencies is the diminishing number of experienced officers due to the retirement rate of baby boomers. This equates to agencies that are understaffed and a force that is gradually becoming a younger and, therefore, less experienced group. With the issues facing law enforcement in today\\'s social climate and the vagueness that can sometimes surround big data use, it is easy to see why law enforcement hasn\\'t been the first to jump on board. But is that reason enough to disregard the benefits and increased efficiency that data CAN offer to our police forces? So what\\'s next...: Some agencies are beginning to see the value in using data to re-focus efforts toward community policing and improving community relationships. A study released by the Police Foundation in 2016 highlighted various positive results from an increase in foot patrol, the most notable effect being an improvement in relationship building between police and citizens. Using data to focus on neighborhoods or city blocks that are most vulnerable, allows agencies to make the most impact, even with limited officer resources. That\\'s where PredPol comes in. Departments are discovering how data can fill in the gaps for a newer, younger emerging police force. New officers using PredPol can receive compressed data about a patrol beat that normally might take months or even years to gather on their own. They can now enter their shift with more knowledge and the ability to use that information to better engage with their community. Seasoned vets can review data showing gradual changes in criminal behavior or activity that can redirect them from what might have become less effective, routine patterns. Agencies now have access to systems that can overcome many of issues that originated with early adopters in data use for law enforcement. PredPol has eliminated the \"garbage in/garbage out\" issue by using only data sourced from a department\\'s records management system (RMS). Since RMS records are entered by officers and detectives (as opposed to CAD records that account for all calls for service), the data is cleaner and more complete, solving the problems associated with data integrity from other sources. Big data not only provides valuable information on its own, it exponentially advances the work an officer can do. Learn more about how Predpol can help your department or agency. ',\n",

       " 'PredPol Partners LAPD-Foothill Records Day Without Crime!: Early PredPol adopters Los Angeles Police (Foothill Division) recorded a day without reported crime - the first known instance of such an event. The following comes from the LAPD Media Advisory: On Thursday, February 13, 2014, LAPD\\'s Foothill Area recorded ZERO Part I crimes for the 24 hour period. This is the first time we have had a \"day without (recorded) crime\" in Foothill in recent memory and it may actually be the first time in our fifty year history where we had no crimes reported to the police. This is a tremendous achievement and a milestone for Foothill Area. To record zero crimes in a 24 hour period in a 50 square mile area of the San Fernando Valley, home to more than 250,000 people, is a tribute to the partnership and teamwork between the police and the public that we have formed over the last few years and an endorsement of the dogged determination of the police officers, detectives and civilian personnel that strive every day to make Foothill Area a safer place to live, work and play. By working closely with community groups, elected officials, other police agencies and social service providers the LAPD\\'s Foothill Area has been able to decrease crime significantly over the last five years. Crime has decreased steadily each year since 2009.  Part I or serious crime has been reduced from nearly 5,000 crime victims in 2009 to 3,800 for 2013, a 23% reduction. Violence is down even more dramatically from 888 victims of violence in 2009 to 510 last year.  That means that 378 fewer people in the communities of Pacoima, Sun Valley and Sunland-Tujunga have been touched by violence in our streets. And the trend is continuing this year. So far in 2014, crime is down 29% year-to-date. That equates to 150 fewer victims this year versus last year at this time... New data driven techniques have also contributed to these declines including the use of a risk based deployment forecasting program from Santa Cruz-based PredPol, Inc. a predictive policing software firm; investigative analysis software designed by Palantir, another silicon valley company and real time data visualization and analysis tools from a partnership between LAPD, the Los Angeles County Sheriff and a San Diego-based tech company called the Omega Group. The use of advanced data analytics allows Foothill Area to place officers in the right place at the right time to prevent crime. The use of Predictive Policing here is a place-based prevention strategy that does not use arrest data and is not arrest-based at all.  In fact, we have seen a decrease in arrests during the pilot testing that we have done.',\n",
       " 'Computerworld Magazine Highlights PredPol Successes: ComputerWorld Magazine just published a great article on predictive policing and PredPol\\'s role. Here is an excerpt: The consolidation of data in a common data warehouse such as N-DEx is just the first step in improving nationwide investigations. The next steps involve the use of data mining techniques to predict where and when crime will occur. This sounds like a page from the script of the movie Minority Report, but the objective isn\\'t to arrest people but to anticipate and remove the opportunity to commit crimes before they can occur. \"9-11 triggered a major paradigm shift in the policing world. It had been a response mission. Now it\\'s a prevention mission,\" says Steve Ambrosini, executive director of the IJIS Institute, an industry consortium of vendors of law enforcement software. \"Predictive policing is at the top of a lot of people\\'s lists,\" says Commander Scott Edson of the Los Angeles Police Department, which uses a commercial software program, Coplink, for its incident management database. \"It\\'s something that Coplink and N-DEx will mature into.\" Initiatives are already well underway at the local level in areas such as Los Angeles, where the PredPol algorithm developed by UCLA has been used to analyze seven years of incident information to predict where, within 500 foot by 500 foot areas, or \"predictive boxes,\" certain types of property-related crimes are most likely to occur during an upcoming patrol shift. And then the department can concentrate on those areas during their shifts, or can redeploy police person-power appropriately. In a 2012 pilot phase, the Los Angeles Police Department Foothills area recorded a 25% decrease in burglaries in a six-month period over the previous year, according to Sean Malinowski, commanding officer of the Real-time Analysis and Critical Response division. \"The idea is to prevent crime.\" Mathematicians developed the model based on an algorithm that\\'s used to predict earthquakes, says Jeffrey Brantingham, chief of research and development at PredPol, a startup formed to market software that uses the PredPol algorithm to make predictions about where crimes are most likely to occur during a patrol shift to other police departments. Like earthquakes, crime occurs along certain fault lines, and events tend to cluster together into a predictable pattern. Work now is expanding beyond car theft, burglary, and burglary from a vehicle, which represent 65% of all crimes, to predict other crimes that fall under the FBI\\'s Part 1 classification, including robbery, rape, assaults and homicide. The Seattle Police Department, another early user of PredPol, started out with property crime predictions, which rolled out to all five of its precincts in May... Since implementing a similar predictive policing system four years ago, the City of Richmond, Va. has seen a significant reduction in all violent crimes and property-based crimes. The results were so good, in fact, that police chief Rodney Monroe implemented a similar system soon after taking on his current position as chief of police in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C...

       " 'Governing Magazine Features Santa Cruz Police and PredPol From Governing Magazine: Full article can be found here: By: John M. Kamensky The use of data to investigate and solve crime certainly isn\\'t new: Crime mapping has been used by detectives since it was developed by an Italian geographer and a French mathematician in 1829. Today, however, new data, statistical tools and other advanced technologies are helping police departments across the country turn traditional police officers into \"data detectives\" who not only solve crime but predict it. \"Predictive policing\" is an adaptation of business techniques initially developed by retailers such as Netflix and Walmart to predict the behavior of consumers. In a new research report for the IBM Center for the Business of Government, Dr. Jennifer Bachner of Johns Hopkins University tells compelling stories of the experiences that several cities are having in using these cutting-edge crime-busting methodologies. The Santa Cruz, Calif., police department was one of the first in the United States to embed predictive policing into its regular day-to-day operations. During the pilot phase, which began in mid-2011, burglaries dropped by 27 percent when compared to the previous year. Since then, the department has increased arrests by 56 percent and recovered 22 percent more stolen cars. What did the Santa Cruz police do? The core of the program, writes Bachner, is \"the continuous identification of areas that are expected to experience increased levels of crime in a specified time-frame.\" The system divides a map of the city into 150-by-150-meter cells. Drawing upon a database of past criminal incidents, a computer algorithm assigns probabilities of crime occurring to each cell, giving greater weight to more recent crimes. Prior to their shifts, officers are briefed on the locations of the 15 cells with the highest probabilities and encouraged to devote extra time to monitoring these areas. \"It\\'s almost like Neighborhood Watch in the next century,\" Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark wrote in a local newspaper. Bachner lists three categories of analytic techniques that Santa Cruz and other police departments are using to predict and prevent various kinds of crime: Analysis of space. There are about a half-dozen \"hot spot\" detection methods. \"Point location,\" for example, involves mapping specific addresses where crimes have been reported and looking for patterns, since crime is more likely to happen near locations that have experienced it in the past. In \"hierarchical cluster\" analysis, crime incidents are grouped to prioritize patterns. And in \"density mapping,\" the resulting map looks similar to a topographical map. Analysis of both space and time. A second, and related, set of techniques goes a step further. For example, a software program called CrimeStat III, developed by the National Institute of Justice, permits examination of the path a criminal has taken. With Series Finder, being developed at MIT, \"an analyst can perform a correlated walk analysis ... which examines the temporal and spatial relationships between incidents in a given sequence to predict the next incident,\" writes Bachner. But while this approach works in theory, she says, it \"requires refinement before it can be regularly used by police departments.\" Analysis of social networks. This approach, aimed at determining persons of interest rather than locations of interest, is new but growing in importance in the new age of social media. Like all human institutions, organized crime and gangs depend on interpersonal relationships. There are a number of different statistical and visualization tools that have been developed to analyze social networks, and Bachner reports that the Richmond, Va., police department, working with Virginia Commonwealth University, has developed a successful pilot program to integrate social network analysis into crime-fighting. Bachner doesn\\'t suggest that predictive analytics -- in policing or in other policy areas -- is some kind of silver bullet. It is an additional tool that supplements existing methods. Community policing, for example, remains an important strategy for deterring crime. \"Nevertheless,\" she notes, \"policing, like many other fields, is undoubtedly moving in a data-driven direction.\" Of course, having the technology doesn\\'t mean it will get used. Analytic techniques such as hierarchical and partitioned clusters can be intimidating to non-analysts. Bachner found that getting buy-in from the on-the-street police officer was crucial and that \"it cannot be imposed on unwilling officers as a replacement for experience and intuition.\" But once officers begin using the tools of predictive policing to supplement their traditional approaches, she writes, they like the results.',\n",
       " 'Geolitica: A New Name, A New Focus: We\\'re pleased to announce that as of today we are changing our name from PredPol to Geolitica. This new name - a mashup of \"geographical analytics\" - better represents the direction our company has taken over the last few years. Our original name of PredPol was a mashup of \"predictive policing,\" and indeed we helped popularize and define that concept when we launched the company in 2012. The idea was that by analyzing historical data we could help better position patrol officers to prevent crime before it occurs. But that phrase has broadened to include activities - such as facial recognition or \"predicting\" that certain individuals will commit crimes - with which we are not aligned; even the use of the word \"predictive\" itself does not accurately describe our business. Rather than predicting, we were conducting risk assessments, using what-where-when historical crime data to identify the highest-risk locations of specified crimes by time of day and day of week. Because our model accounted for things like time of day and day of week, it was far more accurate than the heatmap method used by many police departments, in which they just mapped out all the crimes over some defined period and patrolled the places where the cluster of dots was the densest. However, many of our agencies rightfully wanted additional control over where they sent their officers. Their crime analysts had areas that intel suggested needed additional patrol. Other events, like concerts or sporting events, required officers to patrol in areas that wouldn\\'t appear on a crime heatmap. Accordingly, we added our custom boxes feature, which allowed command staff and analysts to set their own patrol boxes. Soon we had customers who had turned off our \"predictions\" entirely and were setting their own patrol areas. They then used our platform to communicate daily missions and patrol guidance to officers, and to create management reports for crime analysts and command staff. Sometimes an answer is right in front of you but it takes a while to recognize it. Our customers helped us realize that our greatest value was not on the \"predictive\" side of the business, but on the accountability and transparency side. Geolitica is really about patrol operations management. We improve transparency between your department and your community. We provide accountability for your officers. And we make your department more effective at keeping your community safe with the resources you have.    Geolitica: trusted guidance for safer communities.',\n",
       " 'Piedmont, California Civic Organization Highlights PredPol The Piedmont, California Civic Organization penned an article about PredPol\\'s usage in small cities and how it is reducing crime. Here is the article: \"Tight budgets have forced many California cities to reduce the size of Police Departments.  At the same time crime rates are rising. To offset the loss of police officers some cities are turning to Predictive Policing (PredPol), a predictive analytics technology tool developed in California and named one of the \"Best Inventions\" of 2011 by Time magazine. Using the crime date, time and address data already recorded by police departments the software analyzes it and forecasts the time and location for the same crime in the future. Small and medium cities using PredPol --  including Alhambra, Campbell, Los Gatos, Morgan Hill, Salinas and Santa Cruz--are reporting reduced burglaries. The Santa Cruz police personnel decreased by 20% in 2011 while crime increased by 30%.  After the first year using PredPol printouts of predicted hotspots at the start of each shift, Santa Cruz Police reported a 19% reduction in burglaries and added predictions of bike thefts, battery, assault and prowling in late 2012. Putting visible police patrols in the locales at times when burglaries are most likely is thought to be the reason burglaries are prevented.  Predictive Policing is applied to the most frequent crimes in each community and is dependent on the specific crime patterns of each city.  The goal is to make the best use of available police officers.  According to Co.Exist Fast Company, \"Predictive Policing is charging cities based on population, with costs ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per year for the largest cities.\" The Alhambra Police Department explains their decision: \"Developed over a period of six years by cops, mathematicians, criminologists and anthropologists, PredPol is a predictive policing program that looks at burglaries and car thefts and other crimes in a similar manner as predicting aftershocks from an earthquake.  Agencies that have deployed the PredPol tool have seen marked reductions in targeted crimes.  PredPol gives medium sized cities like Alhambra access to complex, large analytic capabilities normally only available to big cities or massive corporations.  The inputs are straightforward: previous crime reports, which include the time and location of a crime.  The software is informed by sociological studies of criminal behavior, which include the insight that burglars often ply the same area.\" Los Angeles experimented with Predictive Policing in just one precinct--Foothill--for six months.  At the end of the trial, the Police Department reported that burglaries in the Foothill precinct decreased 36 percent while crime rose across Los Angeles over the same period. \" http://www.piedmontcivic.org/2013/06/01/predictive-policing-useful-in-small-cities/',\n",
       " 'Predictive Policing Software Featured in GovTech Magazine PredPol\\'s predictive policing software was featured this week in GovTech Magazine. The magazine featured the Santa Cruz Police Department\\'s usage of the program and the reduction in burglaries after implementation. Here is a copy of the story. It can also be found here.  Burglaries are down in the iconic beach community of Santa Cruz, Calif., and police are crediting the drop in crime to the use of predictive policing technology.  The Santa Cruz Police Department compared crime statistics from the first six months of 2012 to the same timeframe in 2011 when the advanced analytics and prediction technology wasn\\'t being used. Without adding more officers to the streets or changing beats and shift times, the results were a 19 percent reduction in property theft.  Zach Friend, press information officer and crime analyst for the Santa Cruz PD, said the program\\'s success really started being noticed a few months after the department installed the system as a pilot project in July 2011. Crime data is pumped into a database and a complex computer algorithm predicts hotspots around the city where officers can expect illegal activity to occur. Once officers got comfortable using data generated from the sophisticated computer algorithm, crime started going down and some arrests were made because of correct predictions.  For example, in August, an officer was out at 12:30 a.m. driving into a zone that the predictive technology told him to check out. He noticed two people attempting to steal a car and arrested them. Until alerted by the police, the car\\'s owner had no idea the vehicle had been tampered with. Source: Zach Friend, press information officer and crime analyst for the Santa Cruz Police Department \"To me, that\\'s the perfect example of the success of the program -- preventing the crimes before they occur in the first place,\" Friend said.  Predictive policing technology is becoming widespread among local law enforcement agencies in the U.S. Los Angeles and Chicago have been using crime stats and analytic tools for a few years now. Other cities such as Rialto, Calif., are just starting their own programs. The Santa Cruz PD bumped its predictive policing program from an experimental phase to full operation in July 2012. In addition to property theft, the system is now used to predict gang activity and street crimes for specialty units in the department.  When officers in one of the specialty units access the system, they can check off selections to run predictive analyses just in their specific area, without the inclusion of property theft data. While statistics on the accuracy of these predictions aren\\'t available yet, Friend said the predictive technology has been able to focus the efforts of those units even further.  In addition, the system is now automated. When the technology was initially deployed, 10 maps featuring the predictive algorithm\\'s crime hot spot findings were manually generated by Friend on a daily basis. Now 15 maps are produced, and supervisors log in to the system prior to briefings and print out a one-page sheet that lists the predicted crime locations for the day.  The information can be accessed online by any officer and the data is refreshed hourly, giving users almost real-time statistical views. Friend said data generated by the system can be accessed by in-car computers and smartphones, but the department hasn\\'t upgraded its equipment yet so it\\'s unable to accommodate it.  Friend believes technology upgrades are inevitable, however.  \"A lot of the younger officers that are coming up are very adept with technology and have an expectation that the technology they use at home will be used ... on the job,\" Friend said.  \"I think [predictive technology] systems like this will be widely adopted, especially by younger generations of officers that are very comfortable with having data in their cars, having maps and the interactivity,\" he added.  While the predictive crime maps are useful, Friend said there aren\\'t any plans to share them with the public. Although the Santa Cruz PD has been using a mobile app to share maps of overall crime, the department views the predictive data as internal tactical information.',\n",
       " 'Tacoma Police Launch PredPol Tacoma Police, using a federal grant for funding, have launched PredPol, the predictive policing program. Here is a story from Q13 TV in Tacoma. \"Tacoma police soon will be using new, sophisticated software to try to predict and prevent five specific crimes -- everything from burglaries to motor theft. It\\'s called PREDPOL, short for predictive policing. Assistant  Police Chief Pete Cribbin said the software promises to predict with high probability where the next crime will occur. \"The beauty of this is it really brings it down, really tight, to a 500-square-foot box so it is very clear where you have to be to try to disrupt the activity,\" he said. It\\'s a complex mathematical formula (a similar algorithm is used to predict the geographical patterns of an earthquake) that assigns a probability that a future event will occur based on past events. Five  years of crime statistics have been stored and once the program begins, it will be updated every  three hours with real-time data. So how is PREDPOL different from hot-spot policing? Cops say a location is a hot spot when there is a pattern of crime in one area but it\\'s still one step behind the criminals. This software is a leap into the future. \"Criminals set patterns they don\\'t think they do, but all human beings set patterns,\" Cribbin said. It also breaks down factors of a neighborhood on why one is more appealing to crooks than others. \"L.A. was using this in one of their divisions for burglaries and they saw a 14 percent decrease in their burglaries,\" he said. The program was paid for by a federal grant and Tacoma police hope to have it going in about two weeks.\" The story can be found here  ',\n",

       " 'LAPD Predicting Crime with PredPol - KQED California Report KQED (NPR Affiliate) ran a story on PredPol and Los Angeles Police on their recent California Report show. Here is an excerpt (and full link below): In an age of big data, California police departments are getting in on the action. In Los Angeles, the LAPD now uses software for what it calls \"predictive policing\"--anticipating where crimes are likely to happen before they happen. Outside the LAPD\\'s Foothill Division station, at the northern edge of Los Angeles, police Sgt. Tom Gahry sits in his black-and-white patrol car. He\\'s shuffling through a stack of maps with bright red squares drawn on them \"These squares,\" Gahry explains, pointing to one of the printouts, \"according to the computer system, there\\'s a high probability that a crime will occur within one of those squares.\" Gahry is one of the officers using predictive policing software called PredPol. It takes crime data, runs it through an algorithm, and then generates these maps. The maps tell police where crimes might happen -- before they take place. Police can spend extra time in the areas at risk for crime, the thinking goes, and prevent those crimes from ever occurring. The LAPD says predictive policing has helped reduce crime here in the Foothill Division. This predictive policing software\\'s journey started seven years ago, at UCLA. There, academics and police officers began using math to study crime. One of the postdocs on the project, mathematician George Mohler, discovered an equation that transformed the work. Mohler, who now teaches at Santa Clara University, realized that, mathematically, earthquakes and crime work in a similar way. Mathematical models for predicting earthquake aftershocks could be applied to predict the \"after-crimes\" of an initial incident. According to Mohler\\'s model, one crime sets off a wave of crimes in an area. The equation draws in details from police reports, such as times, locations and types of crimes that already have happened. Mohler explains, \"The idea would be, after that initial report gets filed, then the model says \\'Hey! There\\'s a risk of after-crimes, or aftershocks.\\' And then the police go into that area and they prevent those second and third crimes from occurring - See more at: http://www.californiareport.org/archive/R201309061630/b#sthash.Iw0B5E7j.dpuf',\n",

The GovTech100 list was created by Government Technology magazine to recognize innovative technology companies making a meaningful impact on governmental operations. \"PredPol is honored to to be included on this list once again,\" said Brian MacDonald, CEO of PredPol. \"With seven years of operations and over 100 million officer-hours of patrol guidance under our belt, we are gratified to see that law enforcement has embraced the philosophy of proactive policing and operational transparency. Of course, who we really need be recognizing are the police officers and sheriff\\'s deputies who put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe.\" PredPol uses machine learning and large datasets to predict where and when crimes are most likely to occur, using just three data points: type of crime, location of crime, and date/time of crime. Where available, PredPol also uses GPS/AVL data to help provide greater visibility into patrol operations. The PredPol platform is available on the CJIS-compliant Microsoft Azure Government Cloud. PredPol uses no personally identifiable information and no demographic information, helping departments avoid the profiling and privacy concerns raised by similar technologies. Our goal from the beginning has been to help law enforcement agencies to reduce rates of victimization by identifying and patrolling those areas where victimization is most likely to occur. At the same time, we believe that protecting the privacy and civil rights of the residents of our communities is as important as protecting them from crime.

       " 'Computerworld Magazine Highlights PredPol Successes ComputerWorld Magazine just published a great article on predictive policing and PredPol\\'s role. Here is an excerpt: The consolidation of data in a common data warehouse such as N-DEx is just the first step in improving nationwide investigations. The next steps involve the use of data mining techniques to predict where and when crime will occur. This sounds like a page from the script of the movie Minority Report, but the objective isn\\'t to arrest people but to anticipate and remove the opportunity to commit crimes before they can occur. \"9-11 triggered a major paradigm shift in the policing world. It had been a response mission. Now it\\'s a prevention mission,\" says Steve Ambrosini, executive director of the IJIS Institute, an industry consortium of vendors of law enforcement software. \"Predictive policing is at the top of a lot of people\\'s lists,\" says Commander Scott Edson of the Los Angeles Police Department, which uses a commercial software program, Coplink, for its incident management database. \"It\\'s something that Coplink and N-DEx will mature into.\" Initiatives are already well underway at the local level in areas such as Los Angeles, where the PredPol algorithm developed by UCLA has been used to analyze seven years of incident information to predict where, within 500 foot by 500 foot areas, or \"predictive boxes,\" certain types of property-related crimes are most likely to occur during an upcoming patrol shift. And then the department can concentrate on those areas during their shifts, or can redeploy police person-power appropriately. In a 2012 pilot phase, the Los Angeles Police Department Foothills area recorded a 25% decrease in burglaries in a six-month period over the previous year, according to Sean Malinowski, commanding officer of the Real-time Analysis and Critical Response division. \"The idea is to prevent crime.\" Mathematicians developed the model based on an algorithm that\\'s used to predict earthquakes, says Jeffrey Brantingham, chief of research and development at PredPol, a startup formed to market software that uses the PredPol algorithm to make predictions about where crimes are most likely to occur during a patrol shift to other police departments. Like earthquakes, crime occurs along certain fault lines, and events tend to cluster together into a predictable pattern. Work now is expanding beyond car theft, burglary, and burglary from a vehicle, which represent 65% of all crimes, to predict other crimes that fall under the FBI\\'s Part 1 classification, including robbery, rape, assaults and homicide. The Seattle Police Department, another early user of PredPol, started out with property crime predictions, which rolled out to all five of its precincts in May... Since implementing a similar predictive policing system four years ago, the City of Richmond, Va. has seen a significant reduction in all violent crimes and property-based crimes. The results were so good, in fact, that police chief Rodney Monroe implemented a similar system soon after taking on his current position as chief of police in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, N.C...

       " 'PredPol\\'s Stance on Privacy, Civil Rights & Transparency: Predictive policing is a broadly defined term, and for many people, one that invokes a distinct feeling of unease. Movies like \"Minority Report\" and recent stories about how Palantir is secretly operating in New Orleans do little to ease those fears.  In an effort to improve discourse on this topic, the team here at PredPol has decided to tell you a little about how we do predictive policing and our philosophy around it. We hope you come away with a better understanding of PredPol\\'s goal to use data to make cities safer, while at the same time preserving the civil rights and privacy of the residents of those cities. PredPol has a pretty narrow definition of predictive policing. For us and our customers, it is the practice of identifying the locations where specific crimes are most likely to occur, then patrolling those areas to prevent those crimes from occurring. Put simply, it\\'s about reducing victimization. Reducing victimization is a hollow victory, however, if it means people have to give up their civil rights or privacy protections along the way. That\\'s why we have consciously worked to ensure that the data and algorithms we use are as objective and transparent as possible. Let\\'s start with the source of our data. In the US, we use only records management systems (RMS) incident data from our law enforcement partners. RMS incident data is collected and managed according to guidelines prepared by the US Department of Justice. The records in the RMS are based on incident reports filed by a patrol officer, which are then reviewed and vetted by a supervisor before being entered in the system. It is the most accurate and objective data to which we have access. The kind of data we use is also important. We make our predictions based on victimization information, i.e. crimes that have been reported to police. This information is anonymized; no personally identifiable information is ever collected or used. The only data items we collect and use are: Notice, that we\\'re not collecting anything else about the victim and nothing at all about an alleged perpetrator. We do not use demographic, economic, or any kind of potential \"profiling\" information about the location or neighborhood where the incident took place. The what-where-when information from the RMS is all our model needs and nothing more. We have found these three data points to be the most effective predictors of future crime activity in time and space. We not only believe that using any sort of personal identifying information isn\\'t appropriate, we stand behind our research that shows that it is *more* effective to exclude it. Companies that use personal information are not only perpetuating concerns in communities, they are making less effective models for reducing victimization. Given the concerns some people have expressed around the idea of using algorithms to direct public policy, we\\'ve also decided to publish the algorithm we use. In fact, we did this years ago in a peer-reviewed article in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. You can read it here: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2015.1077710 It\\'s worthwhile talking about algorithms themselves for a moment. Algorithms are simply the instructions used (generally by a computer) to process information and arrive at an answer. Essentially, any information that is processed by a computer is following the steps described by an algorithm. So what\\'s the value of using an algorithm to recommend patrol locations for police officers? Well, whether we recognize it or not, we are all subject to underlying biases and habits in how we see the world. These biases can influence how we see, perceive and understand things in ways we don\\'t even recognize. This concept of \"cognitive bias\" was introduced by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, who later won the Nobel Prize in Economics for the work he did on this topic. Cognitive bias works against good policing in a couple of ways. First of all, the perception that officers are unfairly targeting certain neighborhoods can justifiably undermine trust between the community and police. It\\'s also an inefficient use of patrol resources. You want your officers to be patrolling the areas where crimes are most likely to occur - using an objective set of transparent criteria - rather than where they think crimes are going to occur. You want officers developing personal and community relationships with traditionally underserved and disadvantaged populations - not patrolling an area out of perception. We have found that our model does not simply guide patrol operations into areas that officers (and even community leaders) may perceive have the most crime, but instead objectively helps guide patrol operations to the areas where victimization is most likely to occur at that time. We know that no model is perfect and we know that there is no magic wand that can eliminate victimization. But we\\'re proud of the work we do here at PredPol. Our goal from the beginning has been to help law enforcement agencies reduce rates of victimization by identifying and patrolling those areas where victimization is most likely to occur. At the same time, we believe that protecting the privacy and civil rights of the residents of our communities is as important as protecting them from crime. The data we use, the technologies we apply, and the transparency we embrace all support this mission. We have found that our work has reduced victimization in the communities that have deployed it - and we are proud of the fact that we seek to be a community partner. It\\'s important to us that we continue to be as transparent as possible, and we appreciate your taking the time to learn a little bit more about what we do. ',\n",
       " 'Are You Holding Your Officers Accountable?: Holding your officers accountable. This may not be as easy as it seems. As a Chief or command officer you hope that your leadership style is one that breeds trust and respect within the department. This means not only making sure that officer morale is strong by rewarding a job well done and caring about your officers as individuals, but also holding them accountable. Holding your officers accountable shows that departmental expectations and values matter and it sets a baseline for performance expectations. What exactly do we mean by \"accountable\"? There\\'s a difference between compliance and commitment. We all know of, or have had an experience with an employee or coworker who shows up each day and goes through the motions. That\\'s being compliant. Effective officers are not just committed to doing their job, but to going above and beyond the call of duty to ensure they are doing everything they can to keeping their community safe. As a command officer it\\'s not always obvious who is compliant and who is committed. So, how can you start to identify those that are just compliant vs. those that are committed? First of all, It\\'s important to know what each officer does while out on patrol and to have a way to manage their performance. If there is no way to measure officer performance then it\\'s harder to see what improvements need to be made in order to achieve the kind of results you\\'re looking for. Accountability isn\\'t about discipline and punishment, it\\'s about seizing the opportunity for improvement. When your employees are managed effectively then you are able to ensure that everyone understands what departmental expectations are and where improvements need to be made. There are many different ways one can measure officer performance. In this new era of data-driven decisions, it is preferable to have a set of objective and quantitative tools to achieve this. The PredPol platform can help. It lets you define missions, assign targeted patrol areas to your officers, monitor their performance on patrol using AVL or GPS, and ultimately measure their crime-prevention impact.  Using a tool like PredPol makes it simple and easy for command staff to see who top performers are and what areas of patrol need the most attention. PredPol helps you hold your officers accountable by managing them to your department\\'s missions. We give command staff insight into exactly how effective their officers are at deterring crime in the areas they patrol. This allows them to give officers feedback right away to ensure that performance improvements can be made in a timely manner. Feedback is important in making sure that everyone is on the same page and all employees are held to the same standard. Our GPS and patrol heat map features shows command staff exactly where their officers patrol and how much time they\\'ve spent in a specific area during their shift. And now, with our new Custom Boxes feature, we\\'ve added another level of control and transparency. Command officers can augment PredPol\\'s patrol recommendations with their own custom patrol areas for special events or assignments. This degree of transparency into patrol operations has given agencies a more objective way to manage their officers and them accountable for their performance. This in turn, creates a more committed culture within the department and allows agencies to be more effective at keeping their communities safe.
